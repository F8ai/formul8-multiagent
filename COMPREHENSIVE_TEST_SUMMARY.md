## 🎯 Root Causes

### 1. Routing Prompt Too Generic
**Issue:** LangChain routing prompt doesn't provide enough context about each agent's specialties.

**Fix Applied:**
- ✅ Updated routing prompt with specific rules
- ✅ Enhanced agent descriptions with keywords and specialties
- ⏳ Not yet deployed/tested

### 2. Agent Keywords Overlap
**Issue:** Many agents have "compliance" in their keywords, leading to confusion.

**Fix Needed:**
- [ ] Review and deduplicate agent keywords
- [ ] Make keywords more specific per agent

### 3. No Routing Confidence Scores
**Issue:** Cannot detect when routing is uncertain.

**Fix Needed:**
- [ ] Add confidence scoring to routing
- [ ] Implement fallback for low confidence

### 4. Topic Coverage Not Enforced
**Issue:** Agent prompts don't require multi-topic responses.

**Fix Needed:**
- [ ] Update agent system prompts
- [ ] Add topic validation logic

# Routing Status Summary

## Current Performance: 33% Accuracy (1/3 sample questions)

### Models Tested:
1. **Llama 3.1 8B** - 33% accuracy
2. **Llama 3.1 70B** - 33% accuracy  
3. **Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B** - (not fully tested)
4. **GPT-4o** - (not fully tested)
5. **Llama 3.1 405B** - 33% accuracy ‚úÖ Currently Deployed

### Test Results (3 sample questions):
- ‚úÖ "Can you make me a compliant SOP..." ‚Üí compliance (CORRECT)
- ‚ùå "Can you help me create a batch tracker..." ‚Üí f8_agent (should be operations)
- ‚ùå "What makes our cannabis brand stand out..." ‚Üí compliance (should be marketing)

### Cost Analysis (per 438 question test):
- Llama 3.1 8B: $0.08
- Llama 3.1 70B: $0.47
- **Llama 3.1 405B: $3.62** ‚Üê Current
- GPT-4o: $3.38

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Model Upgrades Didn't Help:
The fact that routing accuracy stayed at 33% across 8B, 70B, and 405B models suggests:

1. **Prompt May Not Be Reaching the Model**
   - Possible caching issue
   - Config not being loaded properly
   - Routing logic might be using fallback/keyword matching instead

2. **Prompt Structure Issue**
   - Too complex/long for effective routing
   - Model might need simpler, more direct instructions
   - The "KEY DECISION RULES" approach may not be working

3. **Backend Routing Logic**
   - LangChain chain might not be constructed correctly
   - Temperature/maxTokens settings might be interfering
   - Response parsing might be failing

## What We Know Works:
- ‚úÖ Tech Ops mount configured
- ‚úÖ 438 baseline questions collected
- ‚úÖ Agent baseline.json files populated
- ‚úÖ Master baseline.json compiled
- ‚úÖ Deployment pipeline working
- ‚úÖ API responding

## What's Not Working:
- ‚ùå Routing accuracy (stuck at 33%)
- ‚ùå Operations questions ‚Üí f8_agent
- ‚ùå Marketing questions ‚Üí compliance

## Recommendations:

### Option 1: Simplify Routing Prompt Dramatically
Instead of 3000+ token prompt with examples, use minimal prompt:
```
Route this question to: compliance, operations, marketing, formulation, or science

Rules:
- "Can I", "Am I allowed", "requirements" ‚Üí compliance
- "How do I", troubleshooting, process ‚Üí operations  
- Brand, social media, customers ‚Üí marketing
- Recipe, dosage calculations ‚Üí formulation
- Cannabinoid effects, COA ‚Üí science

Question: {message}
Agent:
```

### Option 2: Debug the Routing Chain
- Add logging to see what prompt actually reaches the model
- Verify LangChain chain is being used (not fallback)
- Check if responses are being parsed correctly

### Option 3: Use Keyword-Based Routing
- Disable LangChain routing temporarily
- Use simple keyword matching
- Get to 70%+ with keywords, then add LLM refinement

### Option 4: Test Routing Directly
Create a standalone test that calls OpenRouter API directly to verify:
- Prompt is correct
- Model responds correctly  
- Issue is in integration, not prompt/model

## Next Steps:

1. **Immediate**: Test with drastically simplified prompt
2. **Debug**: Add logging to see actual prompts sent to model
3. **Fallback**: Implement keyword-based routing as backup
4. **Long-term**: Once routing works, expand back to detailed prompts

## Files Modified:
- config/routing.json - Prompt and model config
- config/langchain.json - LangChain settings
- baseline.json - 438 questions

## Commits:
- 438ad2f - Added KEY DECISION RULES
- 84c3f31 - Upgraded to Llama 70B
- 4b0b1eb - Tried Qwen 2.5 Coder
- 7e6a3c1 - Tried GPT-4o
- 8e807ef - **Current: Llama 405B** 

## Status: üî¥ BLOCKED - Need to debug routing logic before continuing

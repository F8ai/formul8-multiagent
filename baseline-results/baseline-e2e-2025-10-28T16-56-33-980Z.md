                    Yes – the regulatory framework for cannabis‑infused products is not a single “one‑size‑fits‑all” set of rules.  Each product category (edibles, beverages, tinctures, topicals, vape cartridges, transdermal patches, etc.) is subject to its own limits on potency, labeling, packaging, testing, and sometimes even licensing requirements.  Below is a concise overview of the most common distinctions in the United States (state‑level) and Canada, which are the two jurisdictions wher...

### 11. Is my edibles packaging compliant to national, state, and local regulations?

F
                    **Short answer:**  In most regulated markets you **must retest the finished pre‑roll** (or at least a representative sample) before it can be sold or labeled, even if the flower and concentrate have already been tested. The act of blending, processing, and packaging creates a *new product* with its own potency profile, possible contaminants, and stability considerations.Below is a concise breakdown of why retesting is generally required, when an exemption might be possible,...

                    **Short answer:** Most U.S. state cannabis‑regulating agencies require a **production (manufacturing) date** (or a “batch/lot” identifier that can be traced back to a production date) on infused products, but **harvest date** is rarely a mandatory label element.  Below is a quick “state‑by‑state” snapshot of the current labeling rules (as of 2024‑06) and what you should put on your edible/infused‑product packaging to stay compliant.## 1.

                    The answer really depends on which product you’re asking about.

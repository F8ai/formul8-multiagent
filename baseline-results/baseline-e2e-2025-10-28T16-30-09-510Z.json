      "question": "What are the requirements in my state for me to be able to introduce or infuse cannabis or botanical-derived terpenes into my products?",
      "category": "product-testing-infusion-rules",
      "agent": "unknown",
      "response": "F\n                    **Short answer:**  Even if the flower you purchase already has a COA from the cultivator, most states still require **a separate, “finished‑product” test** on the pre‑rolls before they can be packaged and sold. The test must cover potency, contaminants, and any additives you introduce. The cultivator’s COA can be used as supporting documentation, but it does **not** replace the final‑product analysis.Below is a quick‑reference guide that works for the majority of U.S. state cannabis programs (the exact numbers may vary by jurisdiction, so always check the specific state’s adult‑use or medical‑use regulations).## 1. Why a new test is required| Reason | Explanation ||--------|-------------|| **Product transformation** | Rolling, trimming, adding filters, or mixing strains can change the cannabinoid/terpene profile and introduce contaminants (e.g., from handling equipment). || **Regulatory definition** | Most states define a “product” as the **final, packaged item** that leaves the facility. The “raw material” test only satisfies the “intermediate” requirement. || **Chain‑of‑custody & traceability** | Regulators must see a COA that is linked to the exact batch of pre‑rolls (batch ID, lot number, date of manufacture). || **Label accuracy** | Consumers must be told the exact THC/CBD content per pre‑roll; this can only be verified on the finished product. || **Safety** | Additional steps (e.g., grinding, handling, storage) can introduce microbes, heavy metals (from equipment), or pesticide residues from the environment. |## 2. Typical testing matrix for a finished pre‑roll batch| Test | Typical limit (varies by state) | Why it matters for pre‑rolls ||------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|| **Potency (THC, CBD, other cannabinoids)** | ±10 % of label claim | Determines dosage per roll || **Terpene profile** (optional but often required) | N/A (report only) | Helps verify strain identity & product consistency || **Microbial – Total Aerobic Count (TAC)** | ≤10⁴ CFU/g (or state‑specific) | Grinding can introduce microbes || **Yeast & Mold** (e.g., *Aspergillus* spp.) | <10³ CFU/g; *A. flavus*/*A. fumigatus* absent | Critical for inhalable products || **Pesticides** (multi‑residue panel) | State‑specific MRLs (often <0.5 ppm) | Residues can concentrate during grinding || **Heavy Metals** (Pb, As, Cd, Hg) | ≤0.5 ppm (or state‑specific) | Metal particles from equipment or storage || **Residual Solvents** (if any extracts are added) | ≤0.5 % (or state‑specific) | Only needed if you add vape‑grade extracts || **Mycotoxins** (e.g., aflatoxins) | <10 ppb | Inhalation risk || **Moisture content** (optional) | ≤12 % (dry weight) | Affects burn quality & shelf life |*If you are only using **flower** (no extracts, no additives), you can usually skip the residual‑solvent panel, but many states still require it as a “blank” check.*## 3. Sampling plan (most common)| Parameter | Sample size | Frequency ||-----------|------------|-----------|| **Batch size** | Typically 1 kg of finished pre‑rolls = one “batch” for testing. Smaller batches may be grouped. | Every batch shipped to retail. || **Sample taken** | 0.5 g*Agent: Formulation Agent | Plan: Free | Tokens: 1220 (220→1000) | Cost: $0.000000*",

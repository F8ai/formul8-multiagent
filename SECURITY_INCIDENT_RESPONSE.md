# üö® Security Incident Response: Exposed OpenRouter API Key

**Date:** $(date)  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** PARTIALLY RESOLVED

---

## üìã Incident Summary

An OpenRouter API key ending in `...095e` was found exposed in a public repository at:
- **Location:** `docs/KEY_TYPES_EXPLAINED.md`
- **Key:** `sk-or-v1-[REDACTED]`
- **Type:** Regular API Key (Production)

---

## ‚úÖ Actions Taken

### 1. Immediate Response
- ‚úÖ **Removed exposed key** from `docs/KEY_TYPES_EXPLAINED.md`
- ‚úÖ **Replaced with placeholder** (`sk-or-v1-[REDACTED]`)
- ‚úÖ **Scanned entire codebase** for additional exposures
- ‚úÖ **Found 16 additional historical keys** in documentation (already revoked)

### 2. Security Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **GitHub Action exists** for automatic key detection (`scan-exposed-keys.yml`)
- ‚úÖ **Detection script available** (`scripts/detect-exposed-keys.js`)
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive scanning** runs on every push/PR

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### 1. Revoke the Compromised Key
**URGENT:** The key ending in `...095e` must be revoked immediately.

#### Option A: Using OpenRouter Dashboard
1. Go to https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys
2. Find the key ending in `...095e`
3. Click "..." menu ‚Üí Delete/Revoke

#### Option B: Using Provisioning API
```bash
# Set your provisioning key
export OPENROUTER_PROVISIONING_KEY="sk-or-v1-YOUR-PROVISIONING-KEY-HERE"

# List keys to find the ID
node scripts/openrouter-key-manager.js list

# Delete the compromised key
node scripts/openrouter-key-manager.js delete --key-id=<KEY_ID>
```

### 2. Generate New Production Key
1. Go to https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys
2. Create new "Regular API Key"
3. Name it: `Formul8-Production-2025-01-XX` (replace XX with today's date)

### 3. Update All Deployments
```bash
# Update GitHub Secrets
gh secret set OPENROUTER_API_KEY --body "sk-or-v1-YOUR-NEW-KEY"

# Update Vercel (all environments)
vercel env rm OPENROUTER_API_KEY production
vercel env add OPENROUTER_API_KEY production
vercel env rm OPENROUTER_API_KEY preview  
vercel env add OPENROUTER_API_KEY preview
vercel env rm OPENROUTER_API_KEY development
vercel env add OPENROUTER_API_KEY development
```

## üîç Additional Findings

The comprehensive scan found **16 additional exposed keys** in documentation files:
- These appear to be **historical keys** that were already revoked
- Located in cleanup guides and documentation
- **No active keys** were found in production code

**Files with historical keys:**
- `QUICK_START_CLEANUP.md`
- `docs/REVOKE_EXPOSED_KEYS_GUIDE.md` 
- `scripts/complete-security-cleanup.sh`

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures in Place

### 1. GitHub Actions
- **Automatic scanning** on every push/PR
- **Auto-fix** exposed keys in documentation
- **Security issue creation** when keys detected
- **PR blocking** until keys are removed

### 2. Detection Capabilities
- Scans for OpenRouter API keys (`sk-or-v1-{64 chars}`)
- Detects Authorization headers
- Identifies environment variable assignments
- Excludes documentation examples

### 3. Prevention
- Pre-commit hooks (can be added)
- GitHub secret scanning (should be enabled)
- Automated key rotation workflows

---

## üìä Impact Assessment

### Production Impact
- **Current Status:** Production may be affected if key is revoked before replacement
- **Risk Level:** HIGH (key is public and can be used by anyone)
- **Mitigation:** Immediate revocation + new key deployment

### Historical Keys
- **Status:** Already revoked (documentation only)
- **Risk Level:** LOW (keys are inactive)
- **Action:** Clean up documentation references

---

## üîÑ Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. ‚úÖ **Revoke compromised key** (`...095e`)
2. ‚úÖ **Generate new production key**
3. ‚úÖ **Update GitHub Secrets**
4. ‚úÖ **Update Vercel environments**
5. ‚úÖ **Test production systems**

### Short-term (This Week)
1. **Enable GitHub Secret Scanning** in repository settings
2. **Add pre-commit hooks** to prevent key commits
3. **Review and clean up** historical key references in docs
4. **Implement automated key rotation**

### Long-term (This Month)
1. **Implement secrets management** (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault)
2. **Add monitoring** for key usage anomalies
3. **Create incident response playbook**
4. **Regular security audits**

## üìù Lessons Learned

1. **Documentation examples** should use placeholders, not real keys
2. **GitHub Actions** are working correctly - they would have caught this
3. **Historical cleanup** needs better documentation management
4. **Key rotation** should be more frequent

## Key Issues Found

### 1. Poor Topic Coverage (Main Issue) üî¥

- Need multi-faceted answers, not just keyword mentions

**Example:**
- Question: "What are the benefits of cannabis?"
- ‚úÖ Keywords found: 6/7 (86%)
- ‚ùå Topics covered: 0/3 (0%)
- Result: F grade despite having keywords

### 2. Agent Routing Problems üü°
- Compliance agent handling too many non-compliance questions
- Operations questions going to compliance agent
- Marketing questions going to compliance agent

**Example:**
- Question: "How do I optimize my cannabis facility operations?"
- Expected: Operations agent
- Actual: Compliance agent ‚ùå
- Result: Response focused on compliance, not operations (31% score)

### 3. Formulation Lacks Specificity üü°
- Missing concrete recipes with measurements
- Vague instructions instead of step-by-step guides
- Dosage calculations not specific enough

3. **Long-form Content** - Average 476 words per response

| "I want to start a cannabis business" | B | 84.29% | Comprehensive coverage of business planning |
| "How do I make cannabis edibles?" | C | 73.33% | Practical instructions with process details |

## Grading Formula

Each response is scored out of 100 points:

- **40 points** - Keyword Matching
  - Checks if expected domain terms are present
  - Example: "THC", "compliance", "extraction"
  
- **40 points** - Topic Coverage  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Main weakness**
  - Checks if multiple aspects of topic are addressed
  - Example: Not just "licensing" but also "compliance", "funding", "planning"
  
- **20 points** - Response Quality
  - Word count (50+ = 10pts, 100+ = 15pts)
  - Formatting (tables/structure = 5pts)

### Grade Scale
- A: 90-100%
- B: 80-89%
- C: 70-79%
- D: 60-69%
- F: Below 60%

## Recommendations Priority

### üî¥ Critical (Do First)
1. **Improve topic coverage** - This is causing most failures
   - Update prompts to ensure multi-aspect responses
   - Target: 75%+ topic coverage (currently 12-25%)

2. **Fix agent routing**
   - Compliance agent is handling too many questions
   - Review routing keywords/logic
   - Test routing accuracy

### üü° Important (Do Soon)
3. **Enhance operations content** - Lowest scoring category
4. **Add formulation specificity** - Need concrete recipes
5. **Improve science depth** - Add technical details

### üü¢ Nice to Have (Do Eventually)
6. **Optimize response time** - Current 7.8s is acceptable but could be faster
7. **Better off-topic filtering**
8. **Add more marketing strategy depth**

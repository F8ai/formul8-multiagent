## 🎯 **The Rule**

### ✅ On OpenRouter Dashboard:

**Provisioning Keys Section:**
- You have: 2 keys
- Keep: "F8 Provisioning" (sk-or-v1-4a6...39a)
- Delete: "GitHub Provisioning Key" ← This one is safe to delete!

**API Keys Section:**
- You have: 1 key "F8-Production-KEEP-THIS"
- ⚠️ **DO NOT DELETE THIS!** ← Your production depends on it!

---

## 🔴 **What Happens If You Delete It**

```
Regular API Key Deleted
        ↓
All OpenRouter API Calls Fail
        ↓
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ❌ 15 Vercel agents DOWN           │
│ ❌ Chat interface broken           │
│ ❌ All AI features offline         │
│ ❌ Production completely broken    │
│ ❌ Customers cannot use F8ai       │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## ✅ **Current Correct Setup**

```
OpenRouter Account:
├── Provisioning Keys (for management):
│   ├── ✅ F8 Provisioning (keep)
│   └── ⚠️ GitHub Provisioning Key (delete this one)
│
└── API Keys (for production):
    └── ✅ F8-Production-KEEP-THIS (DO NOT DELETE!)

GitHub Secrets:
├── OPENROUTER_API_KEY = sk-or-v1-98f...08e (Regular key)
└── OPENROUTER_PROVISIONING_KEY = sk-or-v1-4a6...39a (Provisioning key)

Vercel (All environments):
└── OPENROUTER_API_KEY = sk-or-v1-98f...08e (Regular key)
```

---

## 📝 **Your Next Steps**

### Safe to Do:
1. ✅ Delete "GitHub Provisioning Key" (the duplicate provisioning key)
2. ✅ Keep "F8 Provisioning" (provisioning key)
3. ✅ Keep "F8-Production-KEEP-THIS" (regular API key)

### DO NOT DO:
1. ❌ **DO NOT** delete "F8-Production-KEEP-THIS"
2. ❌ **DO NOT** think you only need provisioning keys
3. ❌ **DO NOT** delete any regular/production API keys

---

## 🧪 **How to Tell Them Apart**

Go to https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys

### Two Separate Sections:

**Section 1: "Provisioning Keys"** (top section)
- These manage other keys
- Safe to have just 1
- Delete the redundant one ("GitHub Provisioning Key")

**Section 2: "API Keys"** or regular keys (bottom section)
- These power your production
- **NEVER delete these!**
- You need at least 1

---

## ⚠️ **If You Accidentally Delete It**

Don't panic, but act fast:

1. Tell me immediately
2. I'll create a new one
3. Update GitHub Secrets
4. Update all Vercel environments
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

**But please don't make me do this a third time!** 😅

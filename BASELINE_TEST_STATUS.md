## ⚠️ Current Blocker

### **chat.formul8.ai Returning Errors**

**Issue:**
```
Response: "I apologize, but I'm currently unable to process your request"
Error: "AI service temporarily unavailable"
```

**Root Cause:**
- The OpenRouter API key we just updated 15 minutes ago hasn't propagated to chat.formul8.ai
- OR chat.formul8.ai is deployed separately and needs a manual update

**Impact:**
- All 438 baseline questions are failing with F grades (25%)
- Cannot get real AI responses for evaluation

---

## 🔧 Solutions

### Option A: Test Against f8.syzygyx.com Instead (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Has the new OpenRouter key (via Vercel)
- Already confirmed working
- Same backend API

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Update test file
const BASE_URL = 'https://f8.syzygyx.com';
```

### Option B: Fix chat.formul8.ai Deployment
**Steps:**
1. Identify where chat.formul8.ai is deployed (Vercel/AWS/other)
2. Update OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable
3. Redeploy or wait for propagation
4. Run tests

### Option C: Wait for Automatic Propagation
- May take 5-30 minutes for env vars to propagate
- Depends on deployment platform

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Now)
1. ✅ Verify OpenRouter key is working (direct API test)
2. 🔄 Switch test URL to f8.syzygyx.com
3. 🔄 Run full 438-question baseline test
4. 🔄 Deploy dashboard to GitHub Pages

### After Test Completes (~15-20 minutes)
1. Generate comprehensive report
2. Create `latest.json` symlink for dashboard
3. Commit and push to GitHub Pages
4. Verify dashboard is accessible
5. Document results

### Follow-up
1. Fix chat.formul8.ai deployment
2. Schedule automated baseline testing (weekly/monthly)
3. Create GitHub Action for continuous monitoring

| **TOTAL** | **438** | |

## ⚠️ Issues Identified

### Routing Accuracy: 33% (1/3 sample test)
- ✅ Compliance question → compliance (correct)
- ❌ Operations question → f8_agent (should be operations)
- ❌ Marketing question → compliance (should be marketing)

### Root Causes
1. **Routing prompt needs more specificity** for operations vs. general questions
2. **Marketing questions** may contain compliance keywords that trigger wrong routing
3. **Agent descriptions** may need clearer differentiation

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Production)
1. **Improve Routing Accuracy to 85%+**
   - Enhance routing prompt with better examples
   - Add negative examples (what NOT to route where)
   - Test with representative questions from each category
   
2. **Push Agent Baselines to Repos**
   - Resolve git conflicts in agent repos
   - Push baseline.json files to remote
   - Verify collection script pulls correct versions

3. **Comprehensive Routing Test**
   - Test all 438 questions
   - Generate routing accuracy report by agent
   - Identify systematic routing errors

### Medium Term
4. **Add More Questions for Under-Represented Agents**
   - Formulation: Need ~20+ questions
   - Science: Need ~20+ questions
   - Spectra: Need ~20+ questions
   - Customer Success: Need ~20+ questions
   - Ad: Need ~20+ questions

5. **Create Validation Question Files for Missing Agents**
   - Check Tech Ops for formulation questions
   - Check Tech Ops for science questions
   - Generate questions based on agent specialties

## 🔧 Tech Ops Sync Commands

```bash
# List available folders
rclone lsd tech-ops:

# Download validation questions
rclone copy "tech-ops:Validation/Compliance Validation Questions.docx" temp-validation/
rclone copy "tech-ops:Validation/Operations Validation Questions.docx" temp-validation/
rclone copy "tech-ops:Validation/Marketing Validation Questions_Kevin_Revised.docx" temp-validation/

# Check Database folder for more questions
rclone ls tech-ops:Database | grep -i "question\|baseline"
```

## 🧪 Testing Commands

```bash
# Parse validation questions and create agent baselines
node parse-and-create-baselines.js

# Collect all agent baselines into master
node manual-baseline-collection.js

# Test routing sample
node test-baseline-routing-sample.js

# Test compliance routing (5 questions)
node test-compliance-routing.js

# Test all questions (full suite - 438 questions)
node test-agent-baseline-routing.js
```

## Summary

**Success:** We have successfully mounted Tech Ops, downloaded validation questions, and created a comprehensive master baseline with 438 questions.

**Challenge:** Routing accuracy is currently 33%, which needs improvement to 85%+ for production readiness.

**Priority:** Focus on improving routing accuracy before deploying or adding more questions.

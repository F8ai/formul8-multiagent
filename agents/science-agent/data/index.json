      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound from Cannabis sativa, shows promise as a therapeutic agent for conditions associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, often involving nitric oxide (NO) signaling dysregulation. This review summarizes preclinical and clinical data on CBD's impact on nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms and NO levels in cardiovascular, neurological, metabolic, and immune systems. Studies suggest that CBD can reduce inflammation-induced inducible NOS (iNOS) expression while maintaining or enhancing endothelial NOS (eNOS)-mediated NO production, leading to decreased oxidative stress, improved endothelial function, and reduced neuroinflammation. The effects of CBD vary based on dose, formulation, timing, and disease state, with potential interactions with metabolites and other drugs affecting safety. Further research is needed to determine optimal dosing, formulation, pharmacokinetics, metabolite profiles, and long-term safety for specific conditions.",

      "abstract": "Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), characterized by seizures that are unresponsive to the use of two or more conventional anti-seizure medication (ASMs), poses a significant therapeutic challenge. In recent years, cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound derived from Cannabis sativa, has emerged as a promising adjunctive therapy for specific, severe epilepsy syndromes. The approval of a highly purified 99% CBD oral solution (Epidiolex&#xae;) has facilitated its integration into clinical practice. However, its effective and safe use requires a nuanced understanding of several practical considerations. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the practical aspects of prescribing and administering highly purified CBD oral solution in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). I address evidence-based dosing strategies, relevant drug-drug interactions, the profile of adverse-drug reactions (ADRs) and their management, and the critical importance of gradual dose titration. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify relevant clinical trials, systematic reviews, observational studies, real-world evidence, and other pertinent publications. A \"start low, go slow\" dosing approach is essential to mitigate ADRs, which are generally mild to moderate but may include somnolence, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and, most notably, elevated liver transaminases, particularly with concurrent valproate use. Significant pharmacokinetic interactions, especially with clobazam, require careful monitoring and potential dose adjustments of concomitant ASMs. This review offers a consolidated overview of the practical considerations for CBD therapy, aiming to support clinicians in optimizing treatment outcomes for patients with DRE while ensuring patient safety.",

      "abstract": "The use of cannabinoids from hemp, which is classified as a cultivar of Cannabis sativa with up to 0.3% delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol by USA federal definitions, is becoming increasingly popular in veterinary medicine. Owners frequently ask about their utility in a variety of conditions, including predominantly osteoarthritis, behavioral management, cancer, dermatitis and seizure disorders. Cannabinoid clinical utility, particularly cannabidiol (CBD) in dogs, is gradually emerging, while evidence for its use in cats remains limited. Several newer publications around the pharmacokinetics of CBD and cannabidiolic acid in cats show dramatic differences in bioavailability, elucidating that not all formulations are similar regarding serum or plasma concentrations. To date, although the pharmacokinetics look favorable, there are a handful of clinical studies on feline acute/chronic pain states and fear/anxiety/stress, alongside some pre-clinical studies where there is a potential for clinical translation. These limited studies, combined with positive owner and veterinary practitioner anecdotes, suggest there may be more opportunities for further pilot investigations to refine dosing and product selection for more randomized, placebo-controlled studies across several morbidities in the future.",

Almost half of states in the United States have legalized recreational use for adults. Fortunately, longitudinal epidemiological studies indicate that less than 20% of youth report current cannabis use and that their lifetime use has actually decreased over the last few decades. Nevertheless, with the increasing availability of different formulations with higher concentrations of THC and notable increase in use among adults, pediatricians need to be more knowledgeable about cannabis and its health effects on children and adolescents. Clinical syndromes, both acute and chronic, evidenced-based screening tools, and treatment modalities are described. Pediatricians can play a unique role in both preventive counseling and engagement in reduction of its use among youth.",

Design: People with advanced cancer enrolled as inpatients in a Phase I/IIb clinical trial, and their carers participated in face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Analysis used the framework method. Setting: Inpatient specialist palliative care. Results: Ten out of 12 trial participants and 6 carers were interviewed. All perceived benefits to eating but, in two cases, this arose from reduced nausea rather than appetite stimulation. Carers sometimes perceive more benefit than patients. Psychoactive effects were well-tolerated and even enjoyed. Burdens included throat irritation and adverse smell and taste, but these were transient. Conclusions: Vaporized flower bud warrants comparison with other formulations/modes of medicinal cannabis for cancer-related anorexia.",

The first semi-synthetic cannabinoids, which were used as legal substitutes for marijuana were &#x394;8-tetrahydrocannabinol (&#x394;8-THC) and hexahydrocannabinol (HHC). &#x394;8-THC emerged around 2019 on the recreational drug market in the United States after it became legal due to an ambiguity in the Agricultural Improvement Act 2018 (Farm Bill 2018). It was never legal outside the United States as the isomers of THC are regulated in the United Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs from 1971. HHC, a hydrogenated derivative of THC, followed as a legal substitute on the European recreational drug market. Many countries already placed HHC in their narcotic substance law, which lead to the emergence of other structurally related derivatives of THC. An existing rapid screening method for the qualitative analysis of various new psychoactive substances was expanded for semi-synthetic cannabinoids in whole blood using a LC-QTOF-MS system. This method was validated for 24 different phytocannabinoids and semi-synthetic cannabinoids in blood. Recovery rates of the analytes from a liquid-liquid-extraction ranged from 87-118%, matrix effects ranged from 24-93%, and limits of detection (LOD) ranged from 0.8-16&#x2009;ng/mL.",

The electrodes are obtained by metal electrodeposition in the simultaneous presence of CBD or THC-models and a lyotropic liquid crystal of a non-ionic surfactant as molecular and supramolecular templates, respectively. This biomimetic approach replicates natural molecular recognition by employing molecularly and supramolecularly imprinted mesoporous metal surfaces, leading to enhanced selectivity and sensitivity in electrochemical detection, enabling discrimination between CBD and THC-models with distinct oxidation potentials. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) reveals detection limits as low as 1.2 and 1.7&#xa0;&#x3bc;M for CBD and THC model, respectively, within a linear range of 10-30&#xa0;&#x3bc;M. Additionally, the sensors maintain excellent performance in real cannabis oil samples and are reusable with minimal loss of sensitivity. These findings open up new perspectives for the development of molecular-imprinted metal electrodes as an interesting alternative to traditional chromatographic methods. Although this study demonstrates the sensor's performance in cannabis oil samples, it is expected that more complex matrices (e.g., plant materials or biological fluids) would require preliminary extraction steps prior to analysis. Nonetheless, the platform shows significant potential for rapid and precise cannabinoid detection for pharmaceutical and quality control applications.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis is the most widely consumed illicit drug worldwide and its rapid expansion into medical and recreational markets has highlighted the need for effective analytical techniques. The analysis of major cannabinoids and their metabolites in different matrices has recently gained considerable attention in fields such as forensics, healthcare, environmental monitoring, and the cannabis food industry. However, the complexity of these matrices, ranging from biological samples to cannabis-infused products, raises significant challenges that require selective and effective extraction methods prior to chromatographic analysis. This review critically evaluates studies published over the past decade (2014-2024) and compares solvent-based and advanced extraction techniques in terms of efficiency, selectivity, and applicability. Although traditional solvent-based methods remain widely used, they often require extensive purification, while advanced approaches offer improved selectivity and environmental sustainability. However, no single technique is universally optimal, as the extraction method should be chosen according to the specific matrix and analytical requirements. Even with the recent progress, challenges, such as method standardization, cannabinoid thermal degradation and the extraction of conjugated metabolites, continue to persist and highlight the need for ongoing research. This review provides a comparative evaluation of current methodologies and identifies key gaps and future directions in cannabinoid analysis for forensic, pharmaceutical, and environmental applications.",

Additionally, cannabidiol (CBD), as well as semi-synthetic cannabinoids, like hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) and &#x2206;8-tetrahydrocannabinol (&#x2206;8-THC), are increasingly found on regulated and unregulated drug markets. A straightforward bioanalytical method was developed, covering 14 analytes, including &#x2206;9-THC, CBD, &#x2206;8-THC, and their respective metabolites, as well as HHC and a subset of minor phytocannabinoids. Sample cleanup consisted of one precipitation step conducted in a 96-well plate format and requiring only 50 &#xb5;L of whole blood. For analysis an ultra high-performance liquid chromatography system coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was used. The method was validated in accordance with ICH M10 and guidelines in forensic toxicology. The method proved to be precise and accurate with a maximal inter assay imprecision of 9.4 % and a maximal accuracy bias of 12.3 %. The validation revealed good recoveries (>86 %), highly consistent matrix effects (relative standard deviation; RSD &#x2264;7 %) and suitable limits of quantification (LOQs), i.e. 0.5 &#xb5;g/L for &#x2206;8- and &#x2206;9-THC. In addition, baseline separation of &#x2206;8-THC-COOH and &#x2206;8-THC from the corresponding &#x2206;9-THC isomers were achieved. Method validation demonstrated a fit for purpose analytical method covering legal thresholds for &#x2206;9-THC for driving. Samples from 4 individuals after inhalation of CBD-rich cannabis were analyzed, whereby 8 out the 14 analytes could be quantified, demonstrating the utility and suitability of the method. The method reduces sample volume, solvent use, and workload, making it well-suited for automation and clinical or forensic applications.",

      "abstract": "Identifying trends in psychoactive substance use is essential for developing effective public health policies. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) offers an objective and rapid approach to monitoring illicit drugs and new psychoactive substances (NPS). Given the continuous evolution of the drug market, it is crucial to establish analytical methods that can simultaneously analyze both conventional illicit drugs and emerging NPS. In this work, we present a novel simultaneous solid-phase extraction procedure coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the qualitative and quantitative determination of 36 psychoactive drugs (30 NPS and 6 illicit drugs) in influent wastewater. The methodology was fully validated, with linearity, accuracy, precision, and robustness meeting all the required standards. Additional assessments were conducted to evaluate filtration loss, matrix effects, and analyte stability. The validated method was applied to 63 influent wastewater samples collected in T&#xfc;rkiye, revealing the presence of several NPS, including 4F-MDMB-BUTICA (detection frequency, 3 %), 4F-MDMB-BINACA-N-4-hydroxybutyl (2 %), ADB-BUTINACA (57 %), mephedrone (5 %), and ketamine (87 %). Biomarkers of illicit drugs (amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, cocaine [i.e., benzoylecgonine], and cannabis [i.e., THCCOOH]) were detected in most samples, with detection frequencies between 65 % and 100 %, although some values were below the limit of quantification. This study represents the first validation of CUMYL-4CN-B7AICA, BZOHEXOXIZID, 5F-BZO-POXIZID, 4F-MDMB-BINACA butanoic acid, and 4F-MDMB-BINACA-N-4-hydroxybutyl in influent wastewater, marking a pioneering effort in T&#xfc;rkiye to monitor NPS and their metabolites through WBE. Considering the lack of historical data on NPS consumption in T&#xfc;rkiye, these findings provide a novel insight into the patterns of NPS use across the country.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis sativa is a short-day (SD) plant, producing inflorescences when the daily scotoperiod (period of darkness) exceeds approximately 10 h of length. As such, the vegetative photoperiod is typically maintained at 16 to 18 h, which limits the scotoperiod to no more than 6 to 8 h and keeps plants in the vegetative stage. The electricity cost associated with supplemental lighting is a major concern for controlled environment cannabis cultivation. Therefore, the strategy of utilizing a 12 h photoperiod while interrupting the scotoperiod with a 1 h \"night break\" (NB) is appealing, as it reduces the overall electricity required for supplemental lighting by nearly one third, while maintaining vegetative growth. Our study tested the feasibility of this method under controlled indoor conditions. We studied the effect of the NB method (as compared to conventional light/dark periods) on cannabinoid and extractable biomass yields, as well as phenotype. Reducing vegetative DLI via the NB method (29.4 &#x2192; 21.2 mol m-2 d-1) reduced extractable floral biomass by ~22% (control 1295 g vs. NB 1015 g per tent), while cannabinoid concentrations were similar between treatments. We also found that NB plants were less vigorous and shorter, with shorter internodes and fewer branches. This evidence suggests that although the NB method may reduce electricity costs during the vegetative stage of controlled environment cannabis growth, the method is not economically feasible due to the loss of yield and plant vigor.",

This has driven the development of analytical techniques to detect cannabinoids in biological matrices. Hair offers key advantages due to its non-invasive collection, extended detection window, stability, and easy storage. This study presents the development and validation of a robust method for extracting natural cannabinoids from hair, following ANSI/ASB 2019, FDA, and Society of Hair Testing guidelines. Hair samples were washed with methanol and cut into small pieces. Approximately 20&#x202f;mg of hair was incubated with 1&#x202f;M NaOH and methanol (30&#x202f;min, 50 &#xb0;C). The mixture was acidified with acetic acid and underwent liquid-liquid extraction using hexane/ethyl acetate (90/10, v/v). The organic phase was evaporated and reconstituted in 1-pentanol/methanol (50/50, v/v). Analysis was conducted by LC-MS/MS using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and triple-stage mass spectrometry (MS&#xb3;). The method was selective, specific, precise, and linear, with working ranges of 5-2000 pg/mg for THC, CBN, and CBD; 50-2000 pg/mg for THC-OH; and 0.2-20&#x202f;pg/mg for THC-COOH. Ion suppression was observed but did not affect sensitivity, with LLOQs and LODs from 0.2 to 50&#x202f;pg/mg. Over 25 hair samples from university students tested positive for cannabis. THC ranged from 5.9 to 2430.7&#x202f;pg/mg; one sample had THC-OH above LLOQ (61.4&#x202f;pg/mg); THC-COOH ranged from 0.3 and 36.4&#x202f;pg/mg; CBN from 5.7 to 461.0&#x202f;pg/mg; and CBD from 5.7 to 850.2&#x202f;pg/mg.

The emergence of the so-called first-generation SCs was followed by other SCs that eventually led to the development of eighth-generation indole/indazole amide-based SCs. Indeed&#xff0c; this entire category of SCs was added to the list of controlled substances on July 1&#xff0c; 2021. SCs can be disguised in various ways and are commonly sold in the form of electronic cigarette oil. SCs quickly enter the bloodstream through the lungs when smoked and are eventually excreted in the forms of precursors and metabolites in urine and feces following oxidation and metabolism&#xff0c; and finally enter the urban sewage system. SCs abuse can be studied and evaluated by analyzing SCs and their metabolites in municipal wastewater&#xff0c; thereby providing a practical reference. Therefore&#xff0c; methods for detecting SCs and their metabolites in wastewater need to be developed.In this study&#xff0c; a solid phase extraction &#xff08;SPE&#xff09;-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry &#xff08;LC-MS/MS&#xff09; method was developed for the simultaneous determination of 38 indazole amide SCs and 15 metabolites in wastewater.

The 38 SCs and 15 metabolites were identified within 11 min using MRM mode&#xff1b; these analytes exhibited good linear relationships and correlation coefficients &#xff08;r&#xff09; exceeding 0.990 5. The limits of detection were 0.03-1.30 ng/L&#xff0c; and the limits of quantification were 0.11-4.30 ng/L&#xff0c; respectively&#xff0c; which meet the requirements for analyzing SCs and their metabolites in actual samples. Precisions &#xff08;n=6&#xff09; were determined to be 2.1%-15.5% by spiking wastewater samples with 10&#xff0c; 50&#xff0c; and 200 ng/L of the 38 SCs and 15 metabolites.

The lower limits of quantification ranged from 0.1 to 1&#x2009;ng/mL. Within-run and between-run precision (CV) were <&#x2009;16%, and bias ranged from -12.8% to 19.8%. Nine of the 20 analytes investigated showed significant ionization suppression or enhancement (>&#x2009;25%). Only two analytes (2C-E and 2-oxo-3-OH-LSD) had a recovery rate lower than 70%. Among the 24 analyzed urine samples, one tested positive for 25B-NBOH, one for LSD, and two for 2-oxo-3-OH-LSD. The developed method enables the simultaneous quantification of 20 illicit drugs, serving as an efficient diagnostic tool for clinical and forensic laboratories.",

      "abstract": "In patients with schizophrenia, cannabis use exacerbates symptoms and can lead to a relapse of psychosis. Some experimental studies in healthy volunteers suggest that pre-treatment with cannabidiol (CBD) may reduce these effects, but others do not. Here, we investigated whether pre-treatment with CBD ameliorates the acute adverse effects of cannabis in patients with schizophrenia. Participants (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;30) had schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder plus a comorbid cannabis use disorder. In a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, participants received oral CBD 1000&#x2009;mg or placebo three hours before inhaling vaporised cannabis (containing &#x394;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 20-60&#x2009;mg). The primary outcome was delayed verbal recall measured with the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised. We also measured psychotic symptoms with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) - positive subscale. Delayed verbal recall after cannabis administration was 3.5 words (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5-4.5) following pre-treatment with CBD, compared to 4.8 words (95% CI: 3.9 to 5.8) following pre-treatment with placebo (mean difference [MD]&#x2009;=&#x2009;-1.3 [95% CI: -2.0 to -0.6]; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.001). After CBD pre-treatment, inhalation of cannabis was associated with an increase in PANSS-P score of 5.0 (95% CI: 3.6 to 6.5), compared to 2.9 (95% CI: 1.5 to 4.3) following pre-treatment with placebo (MD&#x2009;=&#x2009;2.2 [95% CI: 0.6 to 3.7]; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). Administration of CBD did not have a significant effect on plasma concentration of THC or its active metabolite, 11-hydroxy-THC. In patients with schizophrenia and a comorbid cannabis use disorder, pre-treatment with CBD did not attenuate the acute effects of cannabis on memory impairment or psychotic symptoms, but appeared to exacerbate them. The study was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04605393).",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use is increasing in the United States, including among candidates for liver transplants (LTs). Although the anesthesia literature suggests an association between cannabis use and increased postoperative pain, the impact of cannabis use on post-LT opioid use remains unknown. This study investigates changes in cannabis use at a transplant center over time, as well as the impact of cannabis use on post-LT opioid use, health care utilization, and mortality. We included 4236 patients evaluated for LT at our institution between January 2013 and July 2023. Our primary risk factor was cannabis use, defined as urine toxicology positive for cannabis within 90 days of LT evaluation. Our primary outcome was post-LT opioid use, including oral morphine equivalents received during the LT hospitalization and discharge opioid prescriptions. We used multivariable logistic and quantile regression to compare post-LT opioid use, health care utilization outcomes, and mortality between cannabis users and nonusers. Cannabis use was associated with higher oral morphine equivalent use in the 48 hours after LT ( p =0.04). There were no statistically significant differences between groups in 72-hour ( p =0.07) or 7-day cumulative oral morphine equivalent ( p =0.33), opioid prescriptions on discharge ( p =0.25), hospital length of stay ( p =0.69), intensive care unit length of stay ( p =0.94), 90-day readmission ( p =0.66), or 90-day mortality ( p =0.96). While cannabis use before LT was associated with significantly higher opioid use in the immediate postoperative period, this did not translate to differences in opioid use beyond 48 hours after LT, or short-term health care utilization or clinical outcomes. These findings should help set provider expectations for immediate post-LT pain control. Our findings support the growing body of literature that fails to identify an association between pre-LT cannabis use and post-LT outcomes.",

This case report examines the use of medicinal cannabis in a patient treated at the School of Dentistry of Ara&#xe7;atuba (FOA-UNESP). The patient, a 28-year-old female with no comorbidities, presented with chronic muscular TMD and reported poor sleep quality. Full-spectrum cannabis oil (1:1 ratio of THC to CBD), was prescribed for a period of 60 days, with a maximum dosage of 10 drops per day. Pain intensity was measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), while sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Evaluations were conducted at three intervals: baseline, day 30, and day 60. To ensure patient safety, pre- and post-treatment blood tests were performed, and dosage adjustments were made every three days under the supervision of the study's medical team. The results revealed significant improvements in pain management, with the patient's orofacial pain score decreasing from 7 to 3 on the NRS. Additionally, sleep quality improved, as reflected by a lower PSQI score (global sleep quality at level 6 at the end), indicating more restorative sleep. Throughout the treatment period, the patient experienced mild side effects, including drowsiness and gastrointestinal discomfort, which were effectively managed through dosage modifications. In conclusion, full-spectrum cannabis oil shows promise as a therapeutic strategy for managing orofacial pain and improving sleep quality, providing significant relief in conditions where other interventions are ineffective or poorly tolerated. Further research is warranted to better understand the therapeutic mechanisms and potential side effects of medicinal cannabis in the management of chronic pain and related conditions.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has traditionally been associated with amyloid-&#x3b2; plaques, but growing evidence underscores the role of neuroinflammation in disease progression. The autoinflammatory hypothesis of AD suggests chronic immune dysfunction contributes to neuronal damage, making immune modulation a promising therapeutic strategy. Cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid with anti-inflammatory properties, may offer therapeutic potential. This study investigates how CBD independently influences two key neuroinflammatory regulators in AD: the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway and the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) pathway. Though mechanistically distinct, both shape CNS immune responses. Targeting these immune-metabolic axes provides a mechanistic alternative to amyloid- or tau-based approaches by addressing upstream drivers of neuroinflammation and immune dysregulation. Using the male 5XFAD transgenic AD mouse model, we administered CBD via inhalation and assessed IDO and cGAS expression using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence (IF), and gene expression analysis. We evaluated cytokine levels and used STRING-based bioinformatics to identify CBD-target interactions. CBD treatment significantly reduced IDO and cGAS expression, correlating with decreased proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-1&#x3b2;, and IFN-&#x3b3;. Bioinformatics identified potential interactions between CBD and immune targets such as AKT1, TRPV1, and GPR55. These targets were prioritized based on their roles in neuroinflammatory signaling and high-confidence interactions with CBD. AKT1 regulates inflammatory signaling and cell survival, TRPV1 modulates nociception and neuroinflammation, and GPR55 influences immune cell activation. These findings support CBD as a potential monotherapy or adjunctive treatment for AD by targeting distinct neuroinflammatory pathways, including IDO and cGAS. Further studies are warranted to fully explore its therapeutic potential.",

We further delve into the methodological complexities inherent in studying the health effects of high-concentration cannabis products, describing challenges associated with the measurement of exposures and outcomes, confounding, selection bias, and the generalizability of findings. We introduce causal inference methods to mitigate potential biases in observational cannabis use studies. We identify specific areas that necessitate further development and investigation to deepen our understanding of this topic.

      "abstract": "Background: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have transformed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management by promoting glucosuria, lowering glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure, and weight; however, their use is limited by genitourinary infections and ketoacidosis. Phytocannabinoids-bioactive compounds from Cannabis sativa-exhibit multi-target pharmacology, including interactions with cannabinoid receptors, Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPARs), Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels, and potentially SGLT2. Objective: To evaluate the potential of phytocannabinoids as novel modulators of renal glucose reabsorption via SGLT2 and to compare their efficacy, safety, and pharmacological profiles with synthetic SGLT2 inhibitors. Methods: We performed a narrative review encompassing the following: (1) the molecular and physiological roles of SGLT2; (2) chemical classification, natural sources, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of major phytocannabinoids (&#x394;9-Tetrahydrocannabinol or &#x394;9-THC, Cannabidiol or CBD, Cannabigerol or CBG, Cannabichromene or CBC, Tetrahydrocannabivarin or THCV, and &#x3b2;-caryophyllene); (3) in silico docking and drug-likeness assessments; (4) in vitro assays of receptor binding, TRP channel modulation, and glucose transport; (5) in vivo rodent models evaluating glycemic control, weight change, and organ protection; (6) pilot clinical studies of THCV and case reports of CBD/BCP; (7) comparative analysis with established synthetic inhibitors. Results: In silico studies identify high-affinity binding of several phytocannabinoids within the SGLT2 substrate pocket. In vitro, CBG and THCV modulate SGLT2-related pathways indirectly via TRP channels and CB receptors; direct IC50 values for SGLT2 remain to be determined. In vivo, THCV and CBD demonstrate glucose-lowering, insulin-sensitizing, weight-reducing, anti-inflammatory, and organ-protective effects. Pilot clinical data (n = 62) show that THCV decreases fasting glucose, enhances &#x3b2;-cell function, and lacks psychoactive side effects. Compared to synthetic inhibitors, phytocannabinoids offer pleiotropic benefits but face challenges of low oral bioavailability, polypharmacology, inter-individual variability, and limited large-scale trials. Discussion: While preclinical and early clinical data highlight phytocannabinoids' potential in SGLT2 modulation and broader metabolic improvement, their translation is impeded by significant challenges. These include low oral bioavailability, inconsistent pharmacokinetic profiles, and the absence of standardized formulations, necessitating advanced delivery system development. Furthermore, the inherent polypharmacology of these compounds, while beneficial, demands comprehensive safety assessments for potential off-target effects and drug interactions. The scarcity of large-scale, well-controlled clinical trials and the need for clear regulatory frameworks remain critical hurdles. Addressing these aspects is paramount to fully realize the therapeutic utility of phytocannabinoids as a comprehensive approach to T2DM management. Conclusion: Phytocannabinoids represent promising multi-target agents for T2DM through potential SGLT2 modulation and complementary metabolic effects. Future work should focus on pharmacokinetic optimization, precise quantification of SGLT2 inhibition, and robust clinical trials to establish efficacy and safety profiles relative to synthetic inhibitors.",

This study used the carrageenan-induced inflammatory pain model to test oral &#x394;9-THC, CBD, or their combination on acute edema and pain hypersensitivity. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10-14 per sex/group) were pretreated (1 hour) with vehicle (sesame oil), &#x394;9-THC (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg, p.o.), CBD (10, 30, 100 mg/kg, p.o.), or select doses of &#x394;9-THC + CBD combinations prior to an intraplantar &#x3bb;-carrageenan injection into the hind paw. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ketoprofen (10 and 20 mg/kg i.p.) or its vehicle (1:1:18 ethanol:Cremophor EL:saline [Millipor Sigma]) was administered to a separate group as a positive control. Measurements were conducted at baseline and 1, 3, and 5 hours after carrageenan injection. Carrageenan produced edema and hypersensitivity to radiant heat (hyperalgesia) and mechanical pressure (allodynia). &#x394;9-THC alone sex- and dose-dependently decreased hyperalgesia and allodynia but not inflammation, with effects of &#x394;9-THC being greater in females than males, and the lowest &#x394;9-THC dose was proinflammatory in males. CBD alone did not affect pain sensitivity but had modest anti-inflammatory effects in males. Isobolographic and dose addition analyses indicated &#x394;9-THC + CBD was subadditive relative to &#x394;9-THC alone. These data demonstrate that prophylactic oral &#x394;9-THC alleviates acute inflammatory pain with sex-dependent effects, and CBD diminishes &#x394;9-THC antinociception when combined. The findings suggest oral &#x394;9-THC is superior to CBD or combined &#x394;9-THC + CBD for acute inflammatory pain. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Despite the popularity of cannabis for pain management, empirical data on how specific cannabinoid formulations affect acute inflammatory pain are limited. This study in rats found that pure &#x394;-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (&#x394;9-THC) formulations were most effective at improving inflammatory pain compared to pure cannabidiol or &#x394;9-THC + cannabidiol combinations, and females were more sensitive than males to the antinociceptive effects of &#x394;9-THC.",

Our goal was to assess the pharmacokinetic parameters and relative bioavailability of two &#x394;9-tetrahydrocannabinol:cannabidiol (THC:CBD) formulations: orally administered THC:CBD extract and oromucosally administered nabiximols. Methods: This pilot crossover study counterbalanced (1) 1 mL of orally administered THC:CBD extract (10 mg/mL each of THC and CBD in grapeseed oil) and (2) oromucosally administered nabiximols (four sprays of 2.7 mg THC and 2.5 mg CBD per spray, for a total dose of 10.8 mg THC and 10 mg CBD). Blood samples were obtained pre-dose and at 16 post-dose timepoints over 24 h. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for THC, 11-hydroxy-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-THC), and CBD. Results: Twelve occasional cannabis users (6 male, 6 female) were tested under fasting conditions. Cmax for THC and CBD was significantly higher with significantly shorter half-lives for THC:CBD extract versus nabiximols. Cmax for nabiximols was significantly higher in males compared with females. Under both treatment conditions, THC and CBD were undetectable by 24 h post-dose, and 11-OH-THC was markedly reduced from its peak. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Little is known about the comparative pharmacokinetics of commercially available cannabis products. This pilot study shows that the extract formulation achieved higher THC and CBD concentrations within a shorter time frame than nabiximols. These findings may have implications for clinical populations using these formulations therapeutically. Future studies should examine multiple doses in the context of therapeutic outcomes to characterize the relative clinical utility of these formulations.",

The stability of the extracted CBD in pre- and post- encapsulation states were evaluated. Dynamic macerations with ethanol and hexane were compared for CBD extraction. The ethanol extract yielded 0.11% &#xb1; 0.10 CBD and 1.83% &#xb1; 0.00 cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), while the hexane extraction yielded 0.08% &#xb1; 0.04 CBD, 1.06% &#xb1; 0.04 CBDA, and 0.30% &#xb1; 0.04 delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (&#x394;9-THC). Ethanol extraction was selected due to the low THC detection in the extract. The CBD extract was encapsulated using water soluble yellow mustard mucilage (WSM), maltodextrin (MD), gum Arabic (GA), and protein extracted from the hemp biomass waste (HBP) via freeze drying. The WSM-MD-GA 1:5 particle formulation exhibited superior thermal stability over 72 h, whereas the WSM-HBP-GA 1:5 formulation offered the most protection against UVa-induced degradation within the same duration. Incorporating hemp biomass protein as an encapsulation material enhanced protection against light exposure through UV absorption, although it did not grant thermal protection. These findings indicated that encapsulation significantly protects against CBD degradation when subjected to thermal and light conditions compared to non-encapsulated CBD.",

Consistent with their proposed antioxidant activity, the reactive centers in these molecules are the phenoxyl groups. While these molecules also have allylic hydrogens, these seem to play a minor role in their free radical reactions. With excited carbonyls, hydrogen transfer competes with charge-transfer quenching which plays an important role with both benzophenone and xanthone triplets. In the case of THC, charge transfer interactions with carbonyl triplets, rather than hydrogen transfer, is the dominant reaction path. Tests with commercial cannabinoid oil compositions show kinetic and spectral results entirely consistent with those obtained with pure samples, thus suggesting that the hydrogen donor properties and antioxidant activity of cannabinoids are retained in these commercial formulations.",

Neurological and ophthalmological evaluations revealed hypovision or blindness in 87% of cases, with additional epileptic seizures in 13%. Ophthalmological findings included papilledema, optic nerve atrophy, and retinal abnormalities, which were consistent predictors of poor prognosis for vision recovery. Serum vitamin A levels were below the reference range in all cases, confirming a primary dietary deficiency linked to the use of dry, preserved forages.Parenteral administration of vitamin A and dietary supplementation improved clinical outcomes in most cases, with 67% of affected calves achieving complete recovery. Histopathological analysis of one subject revealed ischemic degeneration presumably due to narrowed optic foramina caused by vitamin A deficiency. The findings emphasize the importance of early diagnosis through ocular and neurological assessments to prevent irreversible damage and economic loss in cattle herds. Prompt supplementation can mitigate health and productivity losses, emphasizing its critical role in herd management practices.",

To address these limitations, docetaxel (DTX)-loaded long-circulating liposomal freeze-dried powders were engineered via a synergistic integration of microfluidic technology and lyophilization, optimized through an orthogonal experimental design focusing on particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), and entrapment efficiency (EE). The optimized formulation, incorporating hydroxypropyl-&#x3b2;-cyclodextrin (HP-&#x3b2;-CD) as a lyoprotectant, demonstrated nanoscale particle diameter (&#x223c;120&#xa0;nm), monodisperse distribution (PDI&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.2), and elevated EE (>90&#xa0;%), with physicochemical integrity preserved post-lyophilization. Reconstituted DTX liposomes (DTX-Lip) exhibited pH-dependent sustained release kinetics, with enhanced drug elution at acidic pH (5.5) versus physiological pH (7.4). Solid-state characterization (XRD, FT-IR, DSC) confirmed molecular interactions between DTX and lipid-excipient matrices. In vitro cytotoxicity assays revealed superior apoptotic induction in A549 human lung carcinoma cells by DTX-Lip compared to free DTX solution (DTX-Sol). Pharmacokinetic profiling in vivo demonstrated prolonged systemic circulation of DTX-Lip, marked by significantly elevated area under the curve (AUC0-&#x221e;), maximum drug concentration (Cmax), mean retention time (MRT0-&#x221e;), longer half-life (T1/2), lower clearance (CL) and steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) relative to DTX-Sol (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05). In a C57BL/6 murine lung cancer model, DTX-Lip elicited significant tumor suppression (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05) without mortality, underscoring enhanced therapeutic efficacy and mitigated systemic toxicity. Collectively, the engineered DTX-Lip system combines optimal nano-pharmaceutical attributes (size, homogeneity, EE), controlled release, and favorable in vitro-in vivo performance, offering a robust platform for industrial-scale production of stable, efficacious liposomal DTX formulations. These findings advance translational strategies for liposome-based chemotherapeutics with improved reproducibility and clinical safety.",

Molecular docking confirmed FSK's stable binding across all human ADCY isoforms, supporting upstream cAMP's activation. Cholestatic injury was induced in rats via bile duct ligation (BDL). BDL-rats were treated with either FSK or UDCA. Relative to UDCA, FSK significantly improved liver function (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT) and cholestasis (bilirubin, bile acids) parameters. FSK markedly reduced inflammation markers (IL-6, IL-1&#x3b2;, CXCL1, and CXCL2) and attenuated fibrosis, as evidenced by restored Hydroxyproline levels, COL1A1, and &#x3b1;-SMA expressions. Histological analysis revealed that FSK preserved hepatic architecture, suppressed DR, and downregulated CK19/EpCAM expressions, whereas UDCA showed only partial improvement. Although UDCA significantly modulated Hippo/YAP signaling, FSK substantially activated the pathway through LATS1/2 and YAP1 phosphorylation, suppressing YAP/TEAD transcriptional activity, mediated through cAMP elevation. These findings indicate FSK's multi-target therapeutic actions, mitigating inflammation, DR, and fibrosis mediated by ADCY-cAMP-Hippo/YAP axis modulation. Given its superior efficacy over UDCA, FSK represents a promising therapeutic candidate for clinical translation in CLD.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the color stability of composite resins with different photoinitiator systems when subjected to water aging for 28 days. A total of 48 disc-shaped specimens (1.5 mm in diameter &#xd7; 2.0 mm thick) of 3 commercially available composite resins (n = 16 per group) were fabricated in custom acrylic molds. Each of the composite resins is formulated with a distinct photoinitiator system: diphenyl (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl) phosphineoxide (TPO), bis(4-methoxybenzoyl) diethylgermanium (Ivocerin), or camphorquinone (CQ). The specimens were polymerized with an LED curing unit and stored in a dark room for 24 hours. Baseline color measurements based on International Commission on Illumination (CIE) L*a*b* parameters were recorded with a spectrophotometer. To evaluate the effects of water aging, specimens were immersed in a thermostatic water bath at 37&#xb0;C for 28 days; water was replaced every 7 days. Following immersion, specimens were remeasured spectrophotometrically to assess color change. Color differences between baseline values and values obtained after the aging procedures were calculated for each specimen and statistically analyzed using analysis of variance and post hoc Tukey tests. After 28 days of water aging, all specimens exhibited statistically significant (P < 0.001) overall color changes (&#x394;E*), underscoring a pronounced decline in color stability. A statistically significant difference (P < 0.001) in &#x394;E* was observed between the TPO and Ivocerin groups, with TPO presenting maximum preservation of color stability. No statistically significant difference (P > 0.05) was found between the TPO and CQ groups or the Ivocerin and CQ groups, suggesting somewhat comparable color stability in these groups. Despite color alterations across all materials, the TPO-based composite resin exhibited superior color stability when compared with the Ivocerin- and CQ-based resins in the study, suggesting that TPO may offer enhanced long-term esthetic durability in clinical applications.",

This study elucidates OLEU's role in alleviating oxidative stress and regulating mitochondrial quality control via the PINK1/Parkin pathway. In vitro, H9C2 cardiomyocytes exposed to H&#x2082;O&#x2082;-induced oxidative stress were treated with OLEU (0-200&#x2009;&#x3bc;M), and analyses included cell viability, ROS, SOD, MDA, &#x394;&#x3a8;m, ATP, PINK1/Parkin expression and detection of Mitophagic Flux. In vivo, myocardial infarction (MI) was induced in SD rats via coronary ligation, followed by OLEU administration, with assessments of cardiac function, histopathology, and mitophagy using echocardiography, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Results showed that OLEU (&#x2264;200&#x2009;&#x3bc;M) dose-dependently restored cell viability, reduced ROS, and normalized SOD/MDA (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.05), while mitigating &#x394;&#x3a8;m collapse and ATP depletion, indicating enhanced mitochondrial bioenergetics. OLEU upregulated PINK1/Parkin, promoting mitophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria, and metabolomic analysis revealed modulation of arginine/proline and lipid pathways. In MI rats, OLEU attenuated ROS, preserved myocardial structure, and improved cardiac function, supported by elevated mitophagy in electron microscopy. These findings demonstrate that OLEU protects cardiomyocytes by suppressing oxidative stress, stabilizing mitochondrial integrity, and activating PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy, highlighting its therapeutic potential for myocardial injury and mitochondrial dysfunction.",

To begin, the review outlines the prevalent issue of DON contamination and its adverse effects on gastrointestinal health, underscoring the necessity for a comprehensive understanding of its implications. Subsequently, the discussion focuses on the significance of the Hippo YAP/TAZ pathway in preserving the homeostasis of intestinal stem cells and clarifies the mechanisms by which DON perturbs this essential process.

      "abstract": "Ovulated oocytes deteriorate rapidly if not fertilized within the optimal timeframe, known as postovulatory aging. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), an active ingredient of Astragalus membranaceus, has been demonstrated to have anti-aging and antioxidant effects. However, it has not been elucidated whether AS-IV mitigates in vitro postovulatory oocyte aging. Here, AS-IV was administered into the in vitro culture buffer, and we found that its addition could improve the quality of in vitro postovulatory aged oocytes in mice. Specifically, AS-IV treatment enhanced morphological integrity, preserved spindle/chromosome structure, stabilized actin cytoskeleton, maintained centromere cohesion, and improved ovastacin dynamics in aging oocytes. These improvements collectively enhanced sperm binding capacity and subsequent developmental competence following parthenogenetic activation. Mechanistically, AS-IV appears to inhibit mRNA degradation of antioxidant enzymes and sustain mitochondrial function, thereby preventing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation during in vitro oocyte aging. Meanwhile, reduced oxidative stress in AS-IV-treated oocytes may counteract apoptosis-related mRNA accumulation, delaying apoptotic initiation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that AS-IV supplementation effectively improves the quality of in vitro-aged postovulatory oocytes. This provides a valuable reference and evidence base for its potential application in human-assisted reproductive technology and livestock embryo production.",

Ascolana Tenera oil, containing 100&#xa0;mg/kg of oleocanthal, was selected. Microencapsulation via complex coacervation with gelatin and gum arabic, followed by spray drying, yielded spherical microcapsules (788.4&#xa0;nm) with 70.75&#xa0;% encapsulation efficiency. Characterization by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction, and Scanning Electron Microscopy confirmed structural stability and effective cross-linking. In vitro release studies across 5 food models showed rapid oleocanthal release (50.55&#xa0;% in 120&#xa0;min) in simulated gastric fluid, fitting the Korsmeyer-Peppas model with Fickian diffusion. In intestinal fluid, release reached &#x223c;70&#xa0;%, following the Peppas-Sahlin model. Compared to unencapsulated oil, microcapsules exhibited approximately double antioxidant activity, due to improved oxidative stability and storage resistance. These findings suggest that microencapsulation preserves oleocanthal bioactivity and enables controlled release, making this approach promising for functional food applications.",

Current therapies aim to control inflammation but often result in adverse effects or limited efficacy. Lutein is a natural carotenoid that possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the potential of lutein in mitigating the progression of RA remains unclear. In this study, we utilized dataset GSE55235, comprising transcriptomic profiles of synovial tissues from RA, OA, and healthy individuals, enabling precise discrimination of RA-specific gene signatures. Additionally, we analyzed dataset GSE1919, which contains whole-genome expression data comparing RA synovial tissues with OA and healthy donor tissues, facilitating the characterization of key pathogenic mechanisms underlying RA. Our gene expression analyses revealed significant upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), confirming their pivotal role in RA pathogenesis. RNA sequencing of lutein-treated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) identified differentially expressed genes, with gene set enrichment analysis indicating suppression of RA-related pathways and extracellular matrix degradation. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis demonstrated that lutein inhibits synovial invasion and cartilage destruction by downregulating MAPK and NF-&#x3ba;B signaling. In vitro experiments confirmed that lutein suppresses TNF-&#x3b1;-induced p38, ERK, and NF-&#x3ba;B activation, reducing MMP3 and MMP13 expression and inhibiting FLS migration. These findings were validated in a collagen-antibody-induced arthritis model, where lutein reduced synovial inflammation and joint damage. Collectively, this study highlights lutein's potential as a dietary supplement for RA management by alleviating oxidative stress, suppressing inflammatory responses, and preserving joint integrity. Further clinical studies are warranted to explore its therapeutic applications in RA treatment.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: This study explores whether the cannabis edibles industry uses brand names that might impact consumer appeal and harm perceptions. Materials and Methods: An exploratory thematic text analysis of brand names for 1344 cannabis edible products from 250 brands advertised online between June and November 2022 was performed. Brands marketing only delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products (n = 80), THC and cannabidiol (CBD) products (n = 130), and only CBD products (n = 40) were compared. Results: Five core themes emerged: cannabis culture (42% of brands, n = 106), product characteristics (30%, n = 76), medicine and health (23%, n = 58), environment and nature (20%, n = 51), and identity and culture (14%, n = 34), with 15 subthemes. Brands only marketing CBD products more often had names with medicine and health (45%, n = 18) themes with subthemes of health and wellness (30%, n = 12) and expected effects (18%, n = 7) in contrast to brands marketing THC products (18%, n = 14; 2%, n = 2; 11%, n = 9 THC-only; 20%, n = 26; 5%, n = 6; 13%, n = 17 THC and CBD). Brands marketing THC products more often had names with cannabis (12%, n = 10 THC-only; 18%, n = 23 THC and CBD; 8%, n = 3 CBD-only) and spiritual/mystical (9%, n = 7 THC-only; 9%, n = 12, THC and CBD; 0%, CBD-only) subthemes. Food type subthemes were also more common among brands marketing THC products (19%, n = 15 THC-only; 21%, n = 27 THC and CBD; 8%, n = 3 CBD-only). Unconventionality (6%, n = 5 THC-only; 2%, n = 2 THC and CBD; 0% CBD-only) and names and places (16%, n = 13 THC-only; 5%, n = 8 THC & CBD; 5%, n = 2 CBD-only) were subthemes more common among brands only marketing THC products. Conclusions: This study identified distinct cannabis edibles brand name marketing strategies for THC versus CBD products that may affect consumer appeal and perceptions of harm, underscoring the need to monitor and potentially regulate cannabis edibles marketing to ensure that it does not mislead consumers or downplay potential risks.",

      "abstract": "As cannabis legalization expands across the United States, its use among adolescents remains a pressing public health concern. This analytic essay analyzes the current prevalence, patterns, and consequences of cannabis use in adolescents. While legalization has not substantially increased adolescent use, it has contributed to normalization and greater access, ultimately lowering perceived risk and complicating prevention efforts. Increasing product potency and diversified consumption methods (e.g., vaping, dabbing, edibles) add to these challenges. Adolescent cannabis use is associated with adverse outcomes in brain development, mental health, and physical health including its effects on the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory and endocrine systems of body. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is underdiagnosed and undertreated in youth, with no FDA-approved pharmacological treatments. Psychosocial interventions such as contingency management and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) show modest efficacy, particularly when involving families. This paper highlights the urgent need for targeted education, policy measures, and accessible evidence-based interventions specifically tailored to adolescent populations to address the evolving challenges of cannabis use and its long-term consequences.",

Although designed to mimic the effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis, evidence suggests that certain SSCs may elicit stronger, prolonged and unintended pharmacological effects. SSCs are easily accessible, particularly via online retailers, but in some countries, SSCs are also sold in convenience stores or specialty stores selling legal low-THC or cannabidiol (CBD) products. Often, SSCs are sold as \"legal highs\" and are found in various forms, including herbal mixtures (spice), vape products, and edibles such as cookies and candies, specifically targeting young users, including children. The products are frequently mislabeled and sold as souvenirs or aromatic potpourri to bypass regulations. Case Presentation: We present a case of a male in his early forties who was admitted to the Emergency Department due to noticeable deficits in alertness and responsiveness after recreational ingestion of two cannabis cookies labeled to contain 40 mg \"CC9\" and a bite of a gummy with unknown contents. The patient experienced vomiting and visual problems, and suffered from nine days of cognitive and physical impairment. HHC-C9, a novel SSC, was detected in blood through forensic toxicological analysis. Conclusions: Recreational use of HHC-C9 can cause vomiting, visual disturbances, and drowsiness, potentially requiring hospital treatment. Potency, clinical effects, and toxicity of SSCs can vary significantly, and in combination with easy accessibility, SSCs pose a potential risk of intoxication to unaware consumers.",

Toxicologic testing confirmed a urine 11-nor-9-carboxy-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) concentration >500 ng/mL and serum THC-COOH concentration of 256 ng/mL. Urine benzoylecgonine was also present at 74 ng/mL; no serum cocaine concentration was obtained. The patient returned to his neurologic baseline and was discharged after five days. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of status epilepticus associated with laboratory-confirmed cannabis exposure in a toddler. Clinicians should consider THC toxicity in pediatric patients presenting with refractory seizures.

      "abstract": "In May 2022, semi-synthetic cannabinoids (SSC) appeared on the European drug market, claiming to offer a legal alternative with cannabimimetic effects. Since then, the use of hexahydrocannabinol (HHC) has quickly become very popular and derivatives, among them heptyl-analogs with prolonged alkyl-sidechains and acetylated forms, have appeared. First HHC-bans were introduced in some EU countries in early 2023. As only limited data is available on this dynamic consumption trend, this study aims to analyse a seizure collective comprehensively. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was validated for quantification of (R,S)-HHC, &#x394;8-THC, &#x394;9-THC, CBD, CBG, CBN, (R,S)-HHC-O and CBN-O and applied to a collective of 80 SSC-containing products including flowers, resins, edibles, vape liquids and papers. Further derivatives, among them (R,S)-HHCP, &#x394;9-THCP, &#x394;8-THCP, (R,S)-HHCP-O, (R,S)-H4CBD, THC-O and THCP-O were qualitatively evaluated. HHC-content was characterised by extreme fluctuations from <LOQ up to 70.9 wt-%. &#x394;9-THC was detected in most seizures, with around a quarter of samples exceeding the EU-legal limit for hemp (<&#x2009;0.3&#x2009;wt-% &#x394;9-THC). &#x394;8-THC was rarely found in elevated levels which might indicate residues of HHC-synthesis. H4CBD was the most frequently detected SSC-derivative, followed by heptyl-analogs. Acetates played a minor role and were usually only detected in traces, while elevated levels occurred rarely. Unusual cannabinoid compositions were detected in cannabis carrier material, including extreme CBD-concentrations (up to 67.3 wt-%) and CBG-dominant cultivars.

And their functional properties, structure and nutritional value were compared. RMS-HPI presented a greater protein content but worse protein extraction and recovery rates than AE-HPC did. SDS&#x2012;PAGE indicated that AE-HPC dissociated during the separation process, whereas RMS-HPI remained in the natural state. The RMS-HPI was mainly composed of albumin, whereas the AE-HPC was mainly composed of edestin. Moreover, the RMS significantly improved the color of the HPI. RMS-HPI has higher solubility, foaming ability, oil holding capacity, and emulsification ability, whereas AE-HPC has higher foam stability, water holding capacity, emulsification stability, and decomposition temperature. The FTIR results revealed that a fat absorption peak was observed in AE-HPC, and the number, position and intensity of the absorption peaks of RMS-HPI and AE-HPC were different, which was related to the change in secondary structure. The CD results revealed that the main secondary structures of RMS-HPI and AE-HPC were &#x3b2;-sheets and &#x3b1;-helices, respectively. The large differences in shape, number and type between the AE-HPC and RMS-HPI were observed via SEM, which may be related to their functional characteristics and structure. In addition, the RMS-HPI has advantages in terms of amino acid composition and nutritional profile. These results indicated that reverse micelles could improve the functional and nutritional properties of hemp seed protein, which is helpful for the application of hemp seed protein in food.",

      "abstract": "In this research, hemp protein isolate (HPI) was obtained from hemp cake using isoelectric precipitation and conjugated with maltodextrin through the Maillard reaction using wet-heating alone and combined with ultrasound to enhance its structural, functional properties (including solubility, emulsifying, foaming properties and water/oil holding capcity), and antioxidant properties. Covalent bonds between HPI and maltodextrin were confirmed using methods like SDS-PAGE, FTIR, XRD, fluorescence spectroscopy, secondary structure analysis, amino acid profile, and glycation degree (DG) measurement. Ultrasound significantly accelerated glycation, reaching a DG of 25.06&#xa0;% in just 60&#xa0;min, while reducing melanoidin formation, whereas wet-heating required 24&#xa0;h to achieve a similar level of DG. Structural analysis revealed that wet-heating resulted in greater structural modifications due to its longer reaction time. These changes included a decrease in &#x3b1;-helix and &#x3b2;-sheet structures, higher surface hydrophobicity and zeta potential, and more noticeable microstructural changes. Techno-functional assessments revealed that wet-heating conjugates exhibited superior solubility (up to 95.77&#xa0;%), emulsifying (emulsion stability index up to 48.67&#xa0;%), and foaming (foaming capacity up to 107.14&#xa0;%) properties, and antioxidant properties (71.95&#xa0;% of ABTS), compared to ultrasound-assisted conjugates. This study highlights how ultrasound can intensify the wet-heating glycation of proteins to modify their structure, consequently improving their techno-functional properties to provide a novel plant-based protein ingredient for various food applications.",

This study investigated the long-term storage effects on cannabinoid profiles in Cannabis sativa L. (C. sativa) resin. 150 resin samples, seized by the Royal Gendarmerie of Morocco and stored for long periods of up to 8&#xa0;years, were analyzed. Cannabinoid percentages were quantified using gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (GC/FID). Fresh, unstored cannabis samples initially exhibited the greatest overall extraction yield (37.9&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.45%) and were characterized by high &#x394;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentrations (35.16&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.87%), alongside lower levels of cannabidiol (CBD) (3.92&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.40%) and cannabinol (CBN) (0.87&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.35%). Interestingly, after 2&#xa0;years of storage, a significant decrease in THC content was observed 2.74&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0,33%, accompanied by a corresponding increase in CBD (6.71&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.77%) and CBN (6.94&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;0.83%) concentrations. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed strong correlations between storage time, yield of extraction, and cannabinoid profiles, and enabled the classification of samples based on storage duration and cannabinoids content. Polynomial and multiple regression were developed to predict the relationship between cannabinoid content and storage time. The prediction results indicate that the cubic model exhibit superior predictive performance compared to linear and quadratic alternatives in prediction cannabinoids in terms of storage time. Further, a multiple linear regression model with a hight R2&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.99 was developed to predict the storage time based on cannabinoid levels. These findings provide valuable insights into the long-term stability of cannabinoids in C. sativa resin and hold potential implications for forensic applications, particularly in cases involving the analysis of aged cannabis samples.",

Here, we identified glycosylated cannabinoids and their common intermediate olivetolic acid (OA) in various C. sativa tissues and cultivars. We moreover identified four UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) from C. sativa with OA glycosylating activity. Enhancing the water solubility of cannabinoids through glycosylation holds potential for pharmaceutical development and cosmetic applications. However, glycosylation of pathway intermediates such as OA may divert metabolic flux away from cannabinoid production, complicating efforts to engineer glycosylated forms. To resolve this, we applied FuncLib design to an AlphaFold-predicted structure of one of the identified enzymes CsUGT14, generating active-site variants. Through functional screening, we identified mutants that display increased specificity toward cannabinoid end products over the OA intermediate. Moreover, we recognized a single point mutation that dictates OA positioning within the active site, thereby altering isomer formation. These findings expand the known repertoire of natural cannabinoids and provide a rare example of crystallography-free enzyme design to improve stability, substrate selectivity, and isomer specificity. Furthermore, this work lays the foundation for the tailored biosynthesis of soluble glycosylated cannabinoids in heterologous systems.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use is prevalent worldwide, with smoking being the most common method of consumption. When smoking cannabis, users are exposed to both harmful combustion products and cannabinoids. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor activated by both cannabinoids and combustion products, is known to regulate pulmonary responses to environmental insults. Therefore, we hypothesized that AhR activation would reduce susceptibility to the harmful effects of inhaled cannabis smoke. To investigate this hypothesis, Ahr+/- and Ahr-/- mice were exposed to air or cannabis smoke using a controlled puff regimen over a three-day period. In the first study to characterize the effects of cannabis smoke on lung tissue and the pulmonary secretome, we show that cannabis smoke activates AhR in lung tissue, leading to distinct immunological and proteomic responses across lung tissue, extracellular vesicles (EVs), and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). AhR deficiency exacerbated neutrophilic inflammation, epithelial barrier disruption, and caused systemic cytokine elevation. Proteomic profiling revealed that AhR drives the activation of detoxification and metabolic pathways in lung tissue while suppressing cytoskeletal and adhesion proteins in response to cannabis smoke. In contrast, AhR loss shifted the proteomic response in EVs and BALF, altering coagulation, protease regulation, and metabolic stability. These findings demonstrate that AhR coordinates compartment-specific responses to cannabis smoke and plays a central role in preserving lung homeostasis and restraining inflammatory injury following cannabis exposure. These findings highlight not only the detrimental effects of cannabis smoke on lung health but also the pivotal role of the AhR as a key regulator of the pulmonary response to cannabis smoke exposure.",

ASD-specific features, including repetitive behaviors, constricted interests, cognitive rigidity, and obsessive fixations, are believed to make patients with ASD vulnerable to SUD and ED development. However, little research attempts to understand the interconnection between ASD and these comorbidities. We present a case of a 26-year-old man with a long-standing diagnosis of ASD who developed SUD and restrictive food intake, culminating in the patient meeting the AN criteria. This patient voluntarily admitted himself to the inpatient psychiatric unit with worsening depression and suicidal ideation following a car accident resulting from sleep deprivation and acute cannabis intoxication. Further investigation revealed a problematic, obsessive pattern of initial alcohol use associated with weight gain, followed by profound food restriction and subsequent transition to daily, near-constant cannabis use. On presentation, he appeared anxious with overt signs of sleep deprivation and malnutrition from substantial weight loss with a body mass index (BMI) decline from 23.6 to 16.98 over the last year. A urine drug screen was positive for cannabinoids, and imaging was unremarkable. Over an 11-day hospitalization, a multidisciplinary team initiated anxiolytics, antidepressants, sleep aids, and cannabis-withdrawal management combined with nutritional rehabilitation under dietitian supervision until acute suicidality was resolved with an improved BMI to 18.75. At discharge, the patient reported eagerness to engage with outpatient psychotherapy, ongoing psychiatric follow-up, and ASD-adapted cognitive behavioral therapy. This case underscores the diagnostic and management implications associated with co-occurring ASD, SUD, and ED. Obsessive fixation and rigidity potentiate maladaptive coping, which, if unaddressed in therapy, may increase the risk of future SUD and ED relapse. Though rapid inpatient stabilization is possible, gaps in both specialty care and ASD-adapted programs may compound relapse risk, especially in underserved regions. Additionally, this case necessitates a comprehensive assessment of patients with neurodevelopmental disorders for more informed and integrated therapeutic intervention. The nuanced interplay between ASD, SUD, and ED has synergistic effects on caloric restriction, requiring multidisciplinary treatment strategies to achieve sustained recovery and reduce morbidity in a vulnerable population.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis consumption has and continues to increase dramatically, as does its legalization for recreational and/or medicinal use at the state, but not at the federal level. The increased consumption and legalization have spurred significant cannabis focused research, with particular interest in defining the pharmacokinetic characteristics of this complex natural product. Supporting this research requires a bioanalytical method that accurately and simultaneously quantifies the primary cannabinoids and their metabolites. The objective of this method validation was to meet pre-specified sensitivity targets (0.5&#x2009;ng/mL for most analytes) from a low sample volume (0.2&#x2009;mL) and single extraction approach that could quantify &#x394;9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and their metabolites. Moreover, we sought to rigorously characterize the stability of included cannabinoid analytes, both in solution and plasma. The developed assay required optimization of extraction and mobile phase solvents, as well as mass transitions to achieve the selectivity required to meet the desired sensitivity targets. Stability experiments indicated solution stability of no more than 6&#x2009;months when stored in polypropylene at -30 or -80&#x2009;&#xb0;C and &#x223c;3&#x2009;years (34.5&#x2009;months) of plasma stability when stored in polypropylene at -80&#x2009;&#xb0;C. The assay was successfully applied to &#x223c;1650 samples without a batch failure. This validated LC-MS/MS assay provides unique information on cannabinoid stability and has been utilized to generate novel data on the pharmacokinetics of cannabis constituents and their metabolites.",

Thompson seedless grapes were packed in the resulting films to assess the stability of anthocyanins in stored fruit. Fruit that were packed in 0.5&#x202f;F, 1.0&#x202f;F films were characterised by a gradual increase in anthocyanins after 8,11 and 14 days. For fruit stored in 2.0&#x202f;F film, the increase in anthocyanins was small (p&#x202f;>&#x202f;0.05). After 14 days of storage, the value of anthocyanins in the fruit was 0.51&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;0.02 [%]. In combination with the obtained slow changes in L*, a*, b* parameters for the packaged fruit, it can be concluded that the film limited access to light and oxygen, which slowed down the degradation and oxidation reactions of anthocyanins, as well as the excessive synthesis of these pigments. The resulting eco-friendly packaging film with extract from pollen of Cannabis sativa L., in addition to meeting the requirements of a circular economy, can effectively protect against loss of quality and shelf life of the fruit.",

Here, integrated bioprocess enabled efficient CBGA biosynthesis. Cyclodextrin-mediated stabilization enhanced in vitro CBGA yield by 7-fold to 4 mM by reducing enzymatic degradation. A lycopene-based biosensor identified rate-limiting kinases, doubling geranyl pyrophosphate supply. Combinatorial engineering of NphB, based on prior beneficial mutations yielded a variant with 8.8-fold lower Km and 1.5-fold higher kcat. Computational modeling clarified the mechanism. Incorporating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) regeneration system enabled 5&#xa0;mM CBGA production in vitro with 0.64&#xa0;mM ATP supplied, reducing cofactor demand. In vivo validation in E. coli achieved 16&#xa0;&#xb5;M CBGA production, demonstrating proof-of-concept for microbial production. This work demonstrates a scalable, cost-effective platform for cannabinoid precursor biosynthesis, highlighting that bringing together stabilization, pathway, enzyme, and cofactor engineering is crucial for sustainable industrial production.",

Clinical trial data have demonstrated that CBD carries a risk for severe hepatotoxicity that is greatly increased when prescribed with VPA through an unknown mechanism. The aim of this study was to investigate CBD-induced liver injury in combination with VPA using an in vitro liver model. Three-dimensional human hepatocyte spheroids are an emerging in vitro system that allows investigation of long-term toxicity. Spheroids derived from primary human hepatocytes were treated with vehicle control, 2-200 &#x3bc;M CBD, 0.5-20 mM VPA, CBD + VPA, and 0.1-10 mM acetaminophen (positive control). After 24 h, 8 days, and 15 days of exposure, spheroids were analyzed for ATP depletion, urea production, and CBD and VPA metabolite generation. Untargeted metabolomic analysis was also conducted. A delayed-onset, dose-dependent hepatotoxicity was observed in spheroids exposed to each drug treatment compared to vehicle control. This study is the first to recapitulate the hepatotoxic drug interaction of CBD and VPA in vitro and demonstrates the utility of human hepatocyte spheroids for toxicity studies. Future work is needed to examine mechanisms of CBD-induced hepatotoxicity with VPA.",

However, CBD's limited water solubility and sensitivity to environmental stresses hinder its efficacy and bioavailability. Encapsulation in drug delivery systems, particularly liposomes, offers a promising solution. This study aims to prepare CBD-containing liposomes using commercially used lipids distearoyl phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), and 1,2 distearoyl-sn-glycero-3 phosphoethanolamine-N-[carbonyl-amino(polyethylene glycol)-4300] (ammonium salt) (DSPE-PEG) and to perform in vitro studies - cell viability and CBD release. Liposomes were synthesized using thin-film hydration method, and characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). DLS analysis revealed that CBD incorporation reduced liposome size by 23-53%, depending on the liposomes. Encapsulation efficiency followed the order: DPPC CBD (63%)&#xa0;<&#xa0;DSPC CBD (74%)&#xa0;<&#xa0;DSPC DPPC CBD (81%)&#xa0;<&#xa0;DSPC DSPE-PEG CBD (87%). CBD release profiles indicated that DPPC CBD liposomes released the highest CBD amount initially, while DSPC DSPE-PEG CBD exhibited sustained release, achieving 79% release over 504&#x2009;h. In vitro cell viability tests showed that blank liposomes were non-cytotoxic. However, CBD-loaded liposomes significantly reduced cell viability for defined type of CBD containing liposomes. The inclusion of DSPE-PEG improved encapsulation efficiency and liposome stability, making DSPC DSPE-PEG CBD liposomes more suitable for long-term CBD release. Compared to other studies, encapsulation of CBD in liposomes enhances its bioavailability, allowing lower concentrations of CBD to be directly delivered to cells, resulting in observable changes in cell viability.",

In this study, we evaluated the role of cannabidiol on these behavioral effects of ISD and ISD-induced alterations in targets of the serotonin, endocannabinoid and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) systems. Male mice were treated with cannabidiol (30 or 60&#xa0;mg/kg) and exposed to four episodes of social defeat on PND 47, 50, 53 and 56. Control mice were not exposed to stress. In experiment 1, on PND 57-58, mice were tested in several behavioral tests and, three weeks later, underwent a cocaine-induced conditioned place preference. In experiment 2, the gene expression of the serotonin transporter in the dorsal raphe, corticotrophin-releasing factor in the paraventricular nucleus, proopiomelanocortin in the arcuate nucleus and the glucocorticoid and cannabinoid receptors in the hippocampus were evaluated after the last episode of defeat. CBD reversed the social interaction deficit and the potentiation of cocaine preference, but not anxiety-like effects induced by ISD. In addition, except for the glucocorticoid receptor, ISD reduced gene expression, and this effect was reversed by cannabidiol. Our results indicated the involvement of serotonin, HPA and endocannabinoid systems in the effects of social stress. They showed that CBD is a promising therapeutic agent to prevent social avoidance, enhanced vulnerability to cocaine and gene expression alterations in stress-exposed individuals.",

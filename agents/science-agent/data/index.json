      "abstract": "Phytocannabinoids, unique secondary metabolites of the plant Cannabis sativa L., are characterised by a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities and their use in medicine and food industry has increased exponentially in recent years. In this study, the bioavailability of 10 representatives of neutral cannabinoids and cannabinoid acids was evaluated using an in vitro model of Caco-2 cells, as well as in vivo using an inbred mouse model. In the context of a possible increase in bioavailability, the influence of matrix components associated with the 'cannabis synergy' phenomenon was also investigated. The analysis of cannabinoids and non-cannabinoid matrix components was performed using a sensitive and validated method based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS). As a proof of concept for testing formulation effects on bioavailability, the most abundant cannabinoid and its corresponding acid (CBD and CBDA) were encapsulated in nanomicelles and the effect of the formulation was tested both in vitro and in vivo. The experiments showed that cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) had a significantly better bioavailability compared to cannabidiol (CBD), especially in the in vivo model (CBDA concentrations in mouse plasma were approximately two orders of magnitude higher than those of CBD under the same dosing conditions). These results demonstrate the great potential of CBDA as a previously overlooked and therapeutically underutilized substance.",

Furthermore, upon encapsulation, KS-HP CC-encapsulated probiotics revealed higher bacterial cell viability than those of individual KS and HP-encapsulated probiotic cells, undergoing SGID (&#x223c;89&#xa0;%), during 30&#xa0;days storage (83.2&#xa0;%), and after heat treatment (94.2&#xa0;%), suggesting that KS-HP CC could be a promising encapsulating matrix for probiotic encapsulation for food applications.",

      "abstract": "Polydrug use is a growing concern in the forensic field due to its high risk of overdose and its significant impact on physical and psychological health. Hence, the development of methods for simultaneously analyzing multiple drugs in blood has become increasingly essential recently. The aim of this study is to develop a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous detection of 195 drugs of abuse (DOAs), including amphetamines, opiates, cathinones, phencyclidines, synthetic cannabinoids, cocaine, and metabolites, in 100&#x202f;&#x3bc;L of blood. Blood samples were extracted using liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) with acetonitrile containing 0.1&#x202f;% trifluoroacetic acid, and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was employed for the detection of 195 drugs and metabolites in a single run. The method was validated over a concentration range of 1-100&#x202f;ng/mL for all target compounds, showing good linearity with a coefficient of determination (R&#xb2;) greater than 0.99 for 193 compounds. The limits of quantification (LOQs) of target analytes ranged 0.1-10&#x202f;ng/mL. The method was successfully applied to 20 real blood samples, detecting 22 drugs of abuse and their metabolites, with concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 401.4&#x202f;ng/mL. This developed method is expected to be highly applicable in the forensic or clinical field for the rapid detection of polydrug use.",

      "abstract": "Medical cannabis extracts with similar cannabinoid profiles often produce variable therapeutic effects, suggesting that additional constituents may influence their efficacy. In this study, chlorophyll derivatives (CDs), particularly pheophytins, were identified as natural bioenhancers that enhance the bioavailability of lipophilic cannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD), owing to their amphiphilic structure. A CBD-rich extract with a high content of CDs (high-chlorophyll extract) exhibited a 1.59-fold increase in aqueous dispersibility of CBD compared to an extract with a similar cannabinoid profile but lower CD content (low-chlorophyll extract) (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01). Enrichment of the low-chlorophyll extract with either a pheophytin-rich fraction derived from the high-chlorophyll extract or with purified pheophytin significantly improved CBD dispersibility, reaching levels comparable to those of the high-chlorophyll extract (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.01). Transmission electron microscopy supported these findings, revealing organized, spherical nanodispersions in the pheophytin-rich or enriched samples. These enhancements translated into improved pharmacokinetic profiles, with more than a two-fold increase in both the maximum plasma concentration and the area under the concentration-time curve (p&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05, where applicable) for CBD in rats following oral administration of pheophytin-rich or enriched extracts. Furthermore, these extracts demonstrated superior anticonvulsant efficacy in a pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure model in mice, reducing seizure incidence and latency while increasing survival rates. These findings highlight the therapeutic significance of pheophytins in whole-plant cannabis extracts and challenge the conventional attribution of pharmacological variability among similar cannabis preparations solely to differences in minor cannabinoid content.",

      "abstract": "The therapeutic potential of Cannabis sativa L. and cannabidiol (CBD) for substance use disorders is being actively investigated using murine addiction models. However, the efficacy of cannabis or its constituents in attenuating dependence indicators associated with smoked cocaine consumption remains unclear. This study employed a Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) paradigm using anhydroecgonine methyl ester and cocaine (AEME-COC) as the reinforcing agent to model smoked cocaine consumption in mice. The model was utilized to evaluate the preclinical efficacy of a non-psychoactive cannabis extract (NPCE) and CBD on extinction parameters and reinstatement induced by stress and priming doses. Experiment 1 compared conditioning phase (Cond) and extinction times between subjects administered cocaine and those receiving AEME-COC. Experiment 2 investigated the effects of CBD and NPCE on extinction latency in AEME-COC-induced CPP. Experiment 3 examined the competitive 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100,135 and CB2 receptor inverse agonist AM630 on NPCE-mediated inhibition of stress-induced and priming-induced reinstatement of AEME-COC-induced CPP. The results showed that subjects administered cocaine exhibited greater exploration of the conditioned compartment during Cond compared to those administered AEME-COC, with the latter group displaying prolonged extinction latency (Experiment 1). NPCE, but not CBD, significantly reduced the extinction latency of AEME-COC-induced CPP (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, NPCE selectively inhibited priming-induced reinstatement but did not affect stress-induced reinstatement. The 5-HT1A receptor attenuated NPCE's inhibitory effects on priming-induced reinstatement, whereas the CB2 receptor had no significant modulatory impact on this indicator. These findings suggest that NPCE influences smoked cocaine dependence indicators primarily through serotonergic receptor modulation.",

It begins with an introduction to MIP synthesis techniques that utilize illegal drugs as templates. The subsequent sections explore applications, focusing on the detection of illegal narcotics. The advantages and limitations of MIPs receive detailed examination. A comprehensive literature survey then covers various classes of illicit drugs, including opioids, stimulants, cannabinoids, and hallucinogens. Notably, the review highlights the role of computational simulations, including density functional theory (DFT), in optimizing MIP fabrication and enhancing performance. The review concludes with a discussion on the challenges related to the lack of standard parameters for selectivity, the need for robust characterization methods, and the pros and cons of using nanomaterials in MIPs. Recommendations for resolving these issues and potential future developments aimed at broadening the application scope in relevant fields are presented. Overall, this review serves as a valuable resource for researchers involved in the development and application of illicit drug detection technologies using molecularly imprinted polymers.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis use has increased significantly in the last decade. This article presents a case where a patient needed more local anesthetic (LA) than usual to induce effective anesthesia during hair transplant surgery. The reason cannabis users often need more LA is poorly understood. One possibility is that cannabis withdrawal effect makes patients more sensitive to pain and stress. Additionally, vasodilatory property of cannabis may speed up LA clearance from the application site. The interactions of two major cannabinoids, cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), with cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2), and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptors are also complex. Furthermore, CBD and THC function as cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitors potentially impacting systemic metabolism. When planning to administer LA during hair restoration surgery in cannabis users, clinicians should obtain a detailed history of prior consumption (type of cannabis, frequency, dosage). Preoperative planning should consider the anticipated duration of surgery and calculate the maximum safe LA dose to avoid the risk of toxicity. Also, patients should be carefully monitored for vital signs during surgery. If a patient requires frequent re-injection to remain pain free, the surgeon may need to re-assess the surgical plan to avoid toxicity.",

Despite emergence of this product class, no human laboratory data have directly evaluated the isolated impact of caffeine on &#x394;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (&#x394;9-THC) effects as well as additional impacts of other common co-administered cannabinoids. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, within-subject crossover study evaluated potential pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions between/among &#x394;9-THC, caffeine, and cannabidiol (CBD). Participants (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;20; 10 men/10 women) completed outpatient laboratory sessions in which oral &#x394;9-THC (7.5&#x2009;mg cumulative), caffeine (180&#x2009;mg cumulative), and/or CBD (105&#x2009;mg cumulative) were co-administered in a cumulative dosing design. Primary outcomes included subjective effects indicative of abuse liability (e.g., drug high), performance effects that underlie safety risk (e.g., simulated driving), and plasma cannabinoid/caffeine concentrations. Caffeine co-administration produced minimal changes in &#x394;9-THC-induced subjective effects, performance, or metabolism, although signals for perceived driving impairment were observed. In contrast, CBD, when co-administered with &#x394;9-THC and caffeine increased outcomes associated with abuse liability (e.g., drug high, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002) and performance impairment versus &#x394;9-THC alone. CBD also increased plasma &#x394;9-THC (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004) and 11-OH-&#x394;9-THC (p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.001) concentrations compared with dose conditions without CBD co-administration. These data provide the first direct assessment of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects of &#x394;9-THC and caffeine when co-administered in humans. The robust alteration of &#x394;9-THC-induced effects and &#x394;9-THC pharmacokinetics by CBD further emphasizes the importance of considering full cannabinoid profiles. Broadly, these data highlight the importance of considering drug combinations and interactions in future cannabis regulatory decision-making.",

Cooking is a popular method to utilize cannabis and kratom at the household level. The aim of this research was to study the effect of cooking conditions on psychoactive compounds, namely cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) derivatives (&#x25b3;8, &#x25b3;9THC, and tetrahydrocannabinolic) in cannabis and mitragynine in kratom. Methods: Quantitative analysis of these substances was performed using LC/MS/MS. Cannabis and kratom were subjected to different cooking conditions based on popular cooking methods, including steaming, boiling, deep-frying, stir-frying, and products. Results: The results indicate that boiling and steaming retain the highest content of THC in cannabis. For mitragynine in kratom, there was a varied degree of mitragynine reduction by different cooking methods, which ranged from 20% to 50%. The total phenolic content of all treated samples was lower than the fresh samples. Conclusion: Various cooking methods and product formulation affect THC and CBD quantity, so it is important to assess the retention of those phytocannabinoids in the finished product. However, the adverse effects of THC are unlikely as they are present in low quantities.",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of the most abundant phytocannabinoids isolated from the Cannabis sativa plant. CBD is a lipophilic, non-intoxicating substance that differently from &#x394;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (&#x394;9-THC) does not present the typical profile of a drug of abuse. It shows powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties that might be helpful for treating several pathologies. The aim of this review is to describe the potential role of CBD in the control of food intake and metabolism, with implications for the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome, and to discuss the underlying potential mechanisms of action. The preclinical evidence mentioned reveals that CBD influences eating behaviour, exerting anorexigenic effects and affecting the non-homeostatic aspect of food intake, via modulation of dopamine signalling in the brain reward system. Data from animal models of diet-induced obesity (DIO) and metabolic syndrome show that CBD improves glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammation and ameliorates psychiatric alterations not only in obese animals but also in the offspring born from obese mothers. These effects are achieved targeting multiple proteins expressed both in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. The evidence collected from preclinical research, together with preliminary findings from clinical studies, supports further investigation of CBD in the context of obesity, metabolic syndrome and binge eating behaviour. Future studies are strongly required to highlight the potential role of CBD in these pathologies, specifically to better understand its mechanism of action, and how factors like sex differences, route of administration and formulation might influence the therapeutic activity of CBD.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Cannabinoid formulations have been increasingly proposed as therapeutic potential options for anxiety disorders (ADs). Several countries have expanded regulatory frameworks facilitating access to these compounds due to their alleged therapeutic benefits, including their application in ADs. Given its public health significance, we evaluated existing evidence regarding the efficacy of different medical cannabinoids as interventions for ADs and related mental conditions. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Scielo, and Lilacs databases. We included randomized controlled trials (RTCs) assessing the effects of various cannabinoid formulations on patients with ADs and related conditions. Distinct meta-analyses were performed for cannabinoid subtypes. Analyses were conducted using Jamovi software, relying on standardized mean difference (SMD) calculations of pre/post-intervention score changes for both intervention and control groups. Results: We incorporated 21 placebo-controlled RCTs, examining cannabinoid interventions in social anxiety disorder (SAD = 5), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD = 1), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD = 7), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD = 1), and Tourette syndrome (TS = 7). Data extraction indicated considerable heterogeneity across outcomes, including clinical symptoms, neuroimaging findings, well-being, psychosocial functioning, safety, and tolerability. In studies utilizing pure or enriched CBD, the meta-analytic measure indicated a nonsignificant difference (SMD = -0.40; 95% CI: -0.84/0.03). However, a subgroup analysis of pure CBD compounds yielded a moderate, statistically significant effect size (SMD: -0.61, 95% CI: -1.15/-0.07). For studies investigating pure or enriched delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (&#x394;9-THC), the meta-analytic measure was -0.65 (95% CI: -1.06/-0.24), suggesting a moderate, significant effect favoring &#x394;9-THC-dominant compounds. In meta-analyses of studies with &#x394;9-THC and cannabidiol (CBD) mixtures, the effects were not significant (SMD = -0.73, 95% CI: -2.00/0.55). Although suggesting a potential superior efficacy of pharmaceutically pure formulations of &#x394;9-THC and CBD over alternative versions, these results must be interpreted with caution due to heterogeneous study designs and small sample sizes. Discussion: The current evidence is limited. Low-quality evidence suggests that pharmaceutical-grade CBD may have limited efficacy for SAD and GAD. In addition, low-quality evidence supports &#x394;9-THC's efficacy for the reduction of nightmares in PTSD and tic severity in TS. Further double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials with larger and heterogeneous samples are required to investigate the clinical outcomes of pharmaceutical-grade cannabinoids and standardized cannabis extracts in the treatment of ADs.",

      "abstract": "Cannabinoids have gained increasing attention as potential therapeutic agents in chronic pain management. Their mechanisms of action, mediated through CB1 and CB2 receptors, provide a pharmacological alternative to conventional analgesics. The evidence is strongest for neuropathic pain and multiple sclerosis-related spasticity, while the results for fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, and musculoskeletal pain remain inconsistent. The average pain reduction is modest, often not exceeding 0.5-1.0 points on a 10-point scale, and therapeutic gains are offset by safety concerns. Quantitative data show that discontinuation rates range from 4.3% at low-dose CBD to 12.9% at high-dose CBD, compared with 3.5% on placebo, while nabiximols (THC + CBD spray) are associated with dizziness in 25% of patients, somnolence in 8%, and treatment discontinuation in 12%. High-dose CBD also carries a measurable risk of hepatotoxicity. Regulatory heterogeneity further constrains trial feasibility, scalability, and patient access, with disparities evident across the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia. Overall, cannabinoids provide modest, condition-specific analgesia and should be considered adjunctive rather than first-line options, reserved for patients unresponsive to conventional therapy. Future progress requires standardized formulations, harmonized international regulations, long-term safety data, and large-scale randomized controlled trials to clarify their role in evidence-based pain management.",

The chemical structures and absolute configurations of the compounds were unambiguously determined through comprehensive analyses, including NMR spectroscopy, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HRESIMS), GIAO-based NMR calculations with DP4+ analysis, and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy. Opiparolides A (1) and B (2) were identified as germacrane-type sesquiterpene lactones characterized by a typical &#x3b1;-methylene-&#x3b3;-lactone moiety, while opiparolides C-F (3-6) are classified as C-15-functionalized eudesmane-type sesquiterpene lactones containing an &#x3b1;,&#x3b2;-unsaturated pentatomic lactone ring. Compounds 1-6 were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW 264.7 macrophages, exhibiting IC50 values ranging from 8.6 to 16.8&#xa0;&#x3bc;M. The interactions of sesquiterpene lactones 1 and 6 with the NO signaling pathway were examined through molecular docking studies. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations further explored the structure and molecular properties of compound 6-iNOS complex. The findings highlight the critical importance of preserving plant species diversity as a reservoir for chemically diverse natural products with potential therapeutic applications in inflammation treatment.",

However, the molecular mechanism by which lanosterol binds to crystallins remains incompletely understood. It is crucial to assess whether lanosterol can prevent the aggregation of crystallins under environmental and oxidative stress conditions. It is well-established that the aggregation of &#x3b1;B-crystallin induced by UV-A radiation contributes to the progression of lens opacity and cataract formation. In this study, the inhibitory potential of lanosterol against the aggregation of human &#x3b1;B-crystallin was investigated at the molecular level. Spectroscopic analysis revealed that lanosterol, at a concentration of 75&#xa0;&#x3bc;M, exhibited the most significant suppression of &#x3b1;B-crystallin aggregation in vitro, preserving its secondary structure under UV-A exposure. Lanosterol undergoes a thiol-ene click reaction, thereby preventing the formation of disulfide bonds due to the oxidation of methionine residues in &#x3b1;B-crystallin. By contrast, in the ex vivo mouse lens model, a concentration as low as 50&#xa0;&#xb5;M lanosterol provided the optimal therapeutic effect in terms of lens transparency restoration and light transmission. Western blot analysis showed that lanosterol significantly increased &#x3b1;B-crystallin expression in the lens. Computational modeling further corroborated the experimental findings. These findings offer a novel molecular model for cataract treatment.",

Mechanistic studies confirmed that this compound preserved synergistic cytoprotective effects of its parent pharmacophores against ferroptosis while concurrently exhibiting immunomodulatory activity in microglial cells.

      "abstract": "This study innovatively utilized cellulose-rich Sphagnum palustre L. (SPL) as a porous material for loading carvacrol microemulsion, thereby developing a novel material for mango preservation. Initially, genetic relationship analysis combined with morphological characterization identified Penicillium griseofulvum as a fungal pathogen responsible for mango decay. Based on this finding, carvacrol-a compound with strong antimicrobial properties-was selected as the active agent to formulate a stable oil-in-water (O/W) microemulsion. Through the self-adsorption capacity of the SPL-based porous matrix, a preservation system with controlled release properties and excellent thermal stability was successfully constructed. Gaussian calculation and visualization analysis revealed that the intermolecular interaction between carvacrol and the carrier is primarily dominated by van der Waals forces, a mechanism that can be utilized to achieve controlled release, and the release behavior conforms to the first-order kinetic model. In postharvest mango preservation trials, the porous structure of SPL significantly enhanced the fruit's resistance to mechanical damage (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.001). The addition of 10&#xa0;% (m/m) carvacrol microemulsion effectively delayed the onset of spoilage by at least 6&#xa0;days and significantly reduced weight loss (P&#xa0;<&#xa0;0.05), demonstrating superior preservation performance. In conclusion, this novel plant-derived porous material offers antimicrobial properties, extends shelf life, and provides impact resistance, showing great application potential.",

The Rb1-CDs demonstrated a uniform size distribution (5.3&#x202f;&#xb1;&#x202f;1.5&#x202f;nm), excellent dispersibility, and excitation-dependent fluorescence. In contrast to conventional carbon dots (CDs) derived from non-bioactive precursors, the Rb1-CDs preserved the pharmacological properties of ginsenoside Rb1 while exhibiting enhanced tumor-suppressive effects. In vitro, the Rb1-CDs selectively inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells (HGC27 and AGS) by modulating the MAPK and p53 pathways: suppression of ERK obstructed pro-proliferative signals, while activation of p38/JNK and p53 triggered G2/M cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial apoptosis via the Bax/Bcl-2-Caspase cascade. The unique nanoscale size and abundant surface functional groups of the Rb1-CDs significantly improved cellular uptake and bioavailability of ginsenoside Rb1, outperforming free Rb1. In vivo, the Rb1-CDs notably inhibited tumor growth with minimal systemic toxicity. This remarkable improvement in drug delivery characteristics, combined with the inherent bioactivity of ginsenosides, resulted in potent anti-gastric cancer effects, achieving approximately 74.0&#x202f;% tumor growth inhibition in vivo with minimal systemic toxicity. These results position the Rb1-CDs as a promising nanomedicine for gastric cancer treatment.",

Due to their instability and low concentrations in blood and physicochemical properties, the complexity of endocannabinoid assay is previously reported in different matrices. This study aims to report a LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantification of four endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid congeners: N-arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide or AEA), 2-arachidonoylglycerol/1-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG/1-AG), oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), together with &#x394;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its main metabolites [11-nor-9-carboxy-&#x394;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH) and 11-hydroxy- &#x394;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH THC] in Dried Blood Spot (DBS). This validated method reported LLOQs of 0.1&#x202f;&#xb5;g/L for AEA, 0.5&#x202f;&#xb5;g/L for THC and 11-OH THC, and 1&#x202f;&#xb5;g/L for OEA, PEA, 2AG and THC-COOH. The method demonstrated intra- and interassay accuracy and precision of less than 20&#x202f;% for the LLOQ, and less than 15&#x202f;% for the other calibration points. In particular, the stability carried out in this study demonstrated the practical applicability of DBS for the measurement of endocannabinoids in the whole blood. Therefore, we propose this method as a tool for basic and clinical research to support the growing interest of the scientific community in the endocannabinoid system.",

In this study, hemp seed globulin was produced in E. coli cell factory (recombinant 11S edestin) for the first time to compare the structural differences, morphology, thermal stability, and emulsifying activity with the traditionally salt-extracted hemp seed globulin (SHSG). This study revealed notable differences between them, which can probably be attributed to their distinct structural and morphological features.

Our findings demonstrate that C/F/Gel effectively modulates the inflammatory microenvironment by promoting microglial polarization toward the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype via cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R) activation. Additionally, it regulates the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and significantly improves motor function in SCI mice. Behavioral assessments, histological analysis, and molecular studies confirmed the superior therapeutic efficacy of C/F/Gel compared to single-agent treatments. These results highlight C/F/Gel as a promising biomaterial-based strategy for SCI repair, offering a synergistic approach that integrates inflammation modulation, neuroprotection, and functional recovery.",

      "abstract": "Early stages of drug discovery rely on docking programs to carry out computational screens to find novel potential binders for a protein target. Protein-ligand docking programs consist basically of a search algorithm and a scoring function. This chapter focuses on the search algorithm used in docking simulations. It explains how to use the differential evolution implemented in the Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD) to perform docking simulations against a protein target. Differential evolution is a heuristic method similar to genetic algorithms employed in optimization problems. This algorithm belongs to the class of bioinspired algorithms. This work describes a docking protocol that combines the differential evolution (a search algorithm) and the MolDock score (scoring function available in MVD). Previously published works reported docking simulations against three proteins (cyclin-dependent kinase 2, cannabinoid receptor 1, and transmembrane protease serine 2) using MVD. All docking simulations generated pose structures close to the crystallography coordinates of the ligands. Protein structures employed for docking in this chapter are available in the Protein Data Bank. The Jupyter Notebook discussed in this work is available at GitHub: https://github.com/azevedolab/docking#readme .",

Hence, the discovery of novel molecules that target and modulate this receptor, ideally selectively over its closest relative, the cannabinoid receptor 1, is of great importance. In this study, we aimed to discover novel ligands targeting the CB2R using large library in silico docking screens. However, since the CB2R binding site is difficult to target with in silico methods due to its hydrophobic nature, we used a variety of screening approaches, including the placement of water molecules in predicted water sites of the receptor binding site, and screening against multiple docking setups and receptor conformations. We systematically evaluated these different approaches to support future screens at the CB2R and other receptors. In the present work, each setup contributed different ligands of varying intrinsic activities, leading to an overall improved hit rate compared to that of a single screen. Of the novel ligands of the CB2R discovered and experimentally confirmed in this study, one series features high-affinity ligands with a previously undescribed scaffold.",

      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain, a complex and often devastating condition, poses significant challenges for its effective management. Despite promising research on various cannabis formulations and delivery methods for neuropathic pain, significant gaps remain in our knowledge. While inhaled cannabis shows analgesic effects and alternative delivery methods may improve bioavailability, oral formulations have yielded mixed results, often limited by small sample sizes and placebo effects. Therefore, further research is essential to optimize cannabis formulations, identify responder profiles to tailor treatments effectively, and, most critically, confirm the long-term safety and efficacy of cannabis-based therapies in managing NP. This review article aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the therapeutic potential of cannabis-based medicines, with a particular focus on cannabinoids. This review, though not systematic, examines 11 clinical studies, specifically Randomised Clinical Trials) published from 2014 to 2024, highlighting the efficacy of numerous cannabis formulations, in alleviating neuropathic pain. Key findings show that cannabinoids can reduce pain perception, improve patient quality of life, and mitigate other symptoms associated with neuropathic pain. The synergistic effects of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol are discussed, emphasizing their ability to enhance analgesic effects, while potentially reducing the psychoactive side effects of tetrahydrocannabinol. This review emphasizes the importance of the personalized approach to improve therapeutic outcomes. Limitations of the existing research focusing on cannabis for neuropathic pain are limited by heterogeneity, lack of standardization, small sample sizes, and reliance on subjective outcomes, impacting the reliability and generalizability of findings. However, this exhaustive review aims to inform clinicians and researchers about the evolving role of cannabis in contemporary pain management strategies, illustrating the diverse pharmacological profiles of cannabinoids and their potential as adjunct therapies for neuropathic pain management.",

This study aimed to investigate the PK of CBD formulated using the drug delivery technology DehydraTECH&#x2122;, which is hypothesized to increase absorption by bypassing first-pass liver metabolism due to enhanced lipophilic composition. Anticonvulsant activity of the leading formulation was investigated in the maximal electroshock seizure (MES) model. For the PK studies, Sprague Dawley rats were orally administered 25&#xa0;mg/kg CBD in MCT oil or test formulations incorporating DehydraTECH&#x2122; (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;10 per group). Plasma, brain tissue and urine and feces samples were collected to determine comparative absorption, distribution, and excretion by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). For the efficacy studies, a series of experiments was conducted using the lead formulation (CBDtech) from the PK trial. Effective dose (ED) of CBDtech in comparison to Epidiolex&#xae; (50-100&#xa0;mg/kg), time of peak efficacy (TPE), and median ED (ED50) were assessed in the acute MES model. Clinical observations, presence/absence of hind limb extension (HLE), and maximum seizure severity (MSS) were recorded. No abnormal clinical signs were observed following dosing in any study. Area under the curve from dosing to the last measurable concentration (AUClast) was 391 to 2708% improved following treatment with DehydraTECH&#x2122; formulations as compared with the MCT control (all p&#x2009;<&#x2009;0.01). CBD was detected in brain, urine, and feces samples following all DehydraTECH&#x2122; treatments. Treatment with the ED of CBDtech (75&#xa0;mg/kg) resulted in full protection (absence of HLE) in 66.6% of test subjects following MES test compared to 50% in the Epidiolex&#xae; group. The one-hour timepoint was determined to be the TPE for CBDtech; HLE was absent in 75% of animals and partial in 12.5% of animals. In comparison, in the Epidiolex&#xae; group HLE was absent in 50% of animals and partial in 12.5% of animals. The calculated ED50 was 75&#xa0;mg/kg. Formulation of CBD with DehydraTECH&#x2122; resulted in improved bioavailability and efficacy in an acute seizure model. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of CBD PK and will aid in the design of more effective CBD-based therapeutic interventions.",

By refocusing the route of drug administration beyond the oral gut pathway, this technology provides significant advancements that are especially relevant for cancer treatments. Orally administered drugs face significant challenges as they traverse the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and are subject to first-pass GIT metabolism. Physiological conditions encountered in the GIT such as food effects, hormones, gastric pH, emptying time, and intestinal transit time vary widely across individuals. Fluid composition and enzymatic activity in the small intestine and large bowel also influence drug dissolution and absorption. These factors in conjunction with the intestinal cohort of bacteria can metabolize drugs before absorption, contributing to poor and variable drug bioavailability, which can be exacerbated by gut dysbiosis. Drug delivery that bypasses the oral-GIT route and hence first-pass metabolism offers a plausible solution for enhanced safety and drug efficacy.",

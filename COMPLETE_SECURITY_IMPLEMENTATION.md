## 🔐 Security Actions Completed

### 1. Key Exposure Response ✅

**Problem Identified:**
- Compromised key `sk-or-v1-2fa...3f7` in AWS Lambda
- 3 total exposed keys found in source code
- Keys hardcoded in 4 different files

**Actions Taken:**
- ✅ All 3 exposed keys disabled on OpenRouter
- ✅ Keys removed from source code and replaced with placeholders
- ✅ AWS Lambda functions with exposed keys deleted
- ✅ Currently using only 1 active key: "Syzygyx" (`sk-or-v1-a20...ea6`)

**Files Cleaned:**
1. `chat-vs.html` → Key replaced with `sk-or-v1-REMOVED-EXPOSED-KEY`
2. `public/chat-vs.html` → Key replaced with `sk-or-v1-REMOVED-EXPOSED-KEY`
3. `lambda-package/public/chat-vs.html` → Key replaced with `sk-or-v1-REMOVED-EXPOSED-KEY`
4. `scripts/manual-vercel-setup.md` → Key replaced with `sk-or-v1-your-key-here`

### 2. Infrastructure Cleanup ✅

**AWS Lambda Functions Deleted:**
1. ✅ `formul8-f8-lambda` - Had compromised key, unused (Vercel migration)
2. ✅ `syzychat-backend` - Had exposed key, unused
3. ✅ `syzychat-ai-backend` - Unused

**CloudWatch Logs Deleted:**
- ✅ All associated log groups removed
- ✅ No lingering infrastructure costs

### 3. Secrets Management ✅

**GitHub Secrets:**
- ✅ `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - Current production key
- ✅ `OPENROUTER_PROVISIONING_KEY` - For automation (newly added)
- ✅ `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Existing

**Provisioning Keys:**
- ✅ Using: "F8 Provisioning" (`sk-or-v1-4a6...39a`)
- ⚠️  Manual action: Delete redundant "GitHub Provisioning Key" on OpenRouter dashboard

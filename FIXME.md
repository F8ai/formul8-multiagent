## üö® CRITICAL BUGS (Fix Immediately)

### BUG #1: Agent Routing Complete Failure
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Impact:** 79% of questions incorrectly routed  
**Status:** BROKEN

**Description:**
The LangChain routing system is routing 34 out of 43 questions (79%) to the compliance agent, even when questions are clearly about operations, marketing, sourcing, etc.

**Evidence:**
```
Routing Accuracy: 20.93% (9/43 correct)
- Operations: 0/3 correct (0%)
- Marketing: 0/3 correct (0%)
- Sourcing: 0/3 correct (0%)
- Patent: 0/3 correct (0%)
- Spectra: 0/3 correct (0%)
- Customer Success: 0/3 correct (0%)
- MCR: 0/2 correct (0%)
- Ad: 0/2 correct (0%)
- Editor Agent: 0/2 correct (0%)
- F8 Slackbot: 0/2 correct (0%)
```

**Examples of Incorrect Routing:**
- "How do I optimize my cannabis facility operations?" ‚Üí compliance ‚ùå (should be operations)
- "How should I market my cannabis brand on social media?" ‚Üí compliance ‚ùå (should be marketing)
- "Where can I source high-quality cannabis seeds?" ‚Üí compliance ‚ùå (should be sourcing)

**Root Cause:**
1. LangChain routing prompt not specific enough
2. Agent descriptions too similar
3. No routing confidence scores
4. No fallback logic for low confidence

**Fix Applied:**
- ‚úÖ Updated routing prompts in `config/routing.json`
- ‚úÖ Updated LangChain config in `config/langchain.json`
- ‚úÖ Enhanced agent descriptions in `config/loader.js`

**Still Needed:**
- [ ] Test the updated routing configuration
- [ ] Deploy updated routing to production
- [ ] Add routing confidence threshold
- [ ] Implement fallback keyword matching
- [ ] Add routing decision logging

**Files:**
- `services/langchain-service.js:86-111` - routeToAgent method
- `config/routing.json:29-30` - routing prompt
- `config/langchain.json:31-33` - LangChain routing template
- `config/loader.js:111-120` - getAgentsList method

### BUG #2: Baseline Questions Missing from Agent Files
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Cannot properly test or validate agents  
**Status:** BROKEN

**Description:**
Each agent's `baseline.json` file only contains 1 example question instead of the 3-5 real questions defined in `test-all-agents-baseline.js`.

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// agents/compliance-agent/baseline.json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "compliance-agent-001",
      "question": "Example question for compliance-agent",  // ‚Üê Not a real question!
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected:**
```javascript
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "compliance-001",
      "question": "What are the compliance requirements for cannabis businesses in California?",
      "category": "compliance",
      "expectedAgent": "compliance",
      "expectedKeywords": ["compliance", "california", "license", "regulation"]
    },
    // ... 3-4 more real questions
  ]
}
```

**Root Cause:**
Baseline files were never populated with actual questions from the test suite.

**Fix Needed:**
- [ ] Populate all 14 agent baseline.json files with real questions
- [ ] Run `scripts/compile-baseline.js` to generate root baseline.json
- [ ] Validate compiled baseline structure
- [ ] Update test scripts to use compiled baseline

**Files Affected:**
- `agents/*/baseline.json` - All 14 agent directories
- `baseline.json` - Root baseline (empty)
- `public/baseline.json` - Public baseline (empty)

### BUG #3: No Topic Coverage Validation
**Severity:** üî¥ CRITICAL  
**Impact:** 88% of responses fail to cover multiple topics  
**Status:** BROKEN

**Description:**
Agent responses only cover single topics instead of providing comprehensive multi-aspect answers. Only 5 out of 43 questions (11.6%) covered multiple expected topics.

**Evidence:**
```
Topic Coverage: 12-25% average
- 38 questions covered 0 expected topics
- 5 questions covered 1 topic
- 0 questions covered 2+ topics
```

**Example:**
```
Question: "What are the benefits of cannabis?"
Expected Topics: [medical benefits, therapeutic uses, pain management]
Topics Covered: 0/3
Response: Focused only on compliance requirements
```

**Root Cause:**
1. Agent prompts don't require multi-topic responses
2. No validation of topic coverage
3. Responses are too narrow in scope

**Fix Needed:**
- [ ] Update agent system prompts to require topic coverage
- [ ] Add topic validation logic
- [ ] Create topic coverage guidelines per agent
- [ ] Implement topic detection in grading
- [ ] Add topic coverage monitoring

**Files:**
- `config/langchain.json:35-38` - agent_system template
- `config/langchain-*.json` - All tier configs
- Agent lambda functions - Response generation

## üü† HIGH PRIORITY BUGS (Fix This Week)

### BUG #4: F8 Agent Over-Routing to Compliance
**Severity:** üü† HIGH  
**Impact:** Poor user experience, wrong answers

**Description:**
Questions that should go to f8_agent for general answers are being routed to compliance agent.

**Evidence:**
```
f8_agent routing accuracy: 40% (2/5)
- "What are the benefits of cannabis?" ‚Üí compliance ‚ùå
- "How do I scale up my cannabis production?" ‚Üí compliance ‚ùå
- "What is the meaning of life?" ‚Üí compliance ‚ùå
```

**Fix Needed:**
- [ ] Review f8_agent keywords

### BUG #5: Science Agent Poor Routing
**Severity:** üü† HIGH  
**Impact:** Scientific questions getting wrong responses

**Description:**
Science agent only routes correctly 25% of the time (1/4).

**Evidence:**
```
- "What is THC?" ‚Üí formulation ‚ùå (should be science)
- "How do I test cannabis potency?" ‚Üí compliance ‚ùå (should be science)
- "What is the difference between indica and sativa?" ‚Üí compliance ‚ùå (should be science)
```

**Fix Needed:**
- [ ] Review science agent keywords

- [ ] Improve science vs formulation routing

---

### BUG #6: Formulation Content Too Generic
**Severity:** üü† HIGH  
**Impact:** Users not getting practical recipes/formulas

**Description:**
While formulation routing is 100% accurate, responses lack specific measurements and step-by-step instructions.

**Evidence:**
```
Question: "Create a recipe for cannabis gummies with 10mg THC each"
Grade: F (55%)
Issue: Generic advice without actual recipe, measurements, or instructions
```

**Fix Needed:**

All operations questions ‚Üí compliance agent
```

**Fix Needed:**
- [ ] Verify operations agent deployment status

# ⚡ Real-Time Baseline Dashboard

**Live URL:** https://f8ai.github.io/formul8-multiagent/baseline.html

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. **Playwright Test** (Running Now)
- Tests 438 questions against chat.formul8.ai
- **Saves results every 10 questions** to `docs/baseline-results/latest.json`
- Shows progress: "In Progress: 10/438 questions completed"

### 2. **Watcher Script** (Running in Background)
- Monitors `docs/baseline-results/latest.json` for changes
- **Auto-commits and pushes** to GitHub every 60 seconds when changes detected
- Commit message includes progress: "Update baseline results: 10/438 questions"

### 3. **GitHub Pages** (Auto-Deploys)
- Detects push to main branch
- **Rebuilds site** (takes ~30-60 seconds)
- Dashboard shows latest results automatically!

### 4. **Dashboard** (Updates Live)
- Fetches `latest.json` on page load
- Shows current progress
- Updates grade distribution
- Displays latest Q&A results

---

## 📊 Update Frequency

| Component | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| Test saves results | Every 10 questions (~30 seconds) |
| Watcher checks for changes | Every 60 seconds |
| GitHub Pages rebuilds | When changes pushed (~30-60s) |
| **Total update cycle** | **~2-3 minutes** |

So you'll see new results every 2-3 minutes on the live dashboard!

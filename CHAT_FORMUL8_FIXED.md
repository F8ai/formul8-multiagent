# ✅ chat.formul8.ai - FIXED!

**Date:** October 28, 2025, 4:30 PM PST  
**Status:** ✅ **OPERATIONAL**

---

## 🎯 Problem

**chat.formul8.ai** and **f8.syzygyx.com** were both returning errors:
```
"I apologize, but I'm currently unable to process your request"
"Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again"
```

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

- **New OpenRouter API key** was created and updated in GitHub Secrets  and Vercel environment variables 20 minutes prior
- **Vercel deployments** had not picked up the new environment variable
- Applications were still trying to use the old (revoked) API key
- Result: All API calls to OpenRouter were failing

---

## 🔧 Solution

### Step 1: Verified Key Was Valid
```bash
curl -X POST https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-or-v1-98f...08e" \
  ...

Result: ✅ KEY WORKING
```

### Step 2: Identified Deployment Platform
```bash
curl -sI https://chat.formul8.ai | grep server

Result: server: Vercel
```

### Step 3: Triggered Production Redeploy
```bash
vercel --prod

Result: 
- New deployment: formul8-multiagent-lasxda4no-formul8ai.vercel.app
- Picked up new OPENROUTER_API_KEY from environment
- Deployed to chat.formul8.ai
```

### Step 4: Verified Fix
```bash
curl -X POST https://chat.formul8.ai/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"test"}'

Result: ✅ SUCCESS
{
  "success": true,
  "response": "Hello! Your test came through successfully...",
  "agent": "f8_agent",
  "agentName": "F8 Multi-Agent",
  "plan": "standard",
  "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 152, "completion_tokens": 44},
  "cost": "$0.000000"
}
```

## 🔑 Key Learnings

### Environment Variable Propagation
- Updating Vercel env vars doesn't automatically redeploy
- Must trigger manual redeploy with `vercel --prod`
- Or wait for next code push to trigger automatic deployment

### OpenRouter Key Management
- ✅ Provisioning Key: For managing API keys
- ✅ Regular API Key: For making AI API calls
- ⚠️ Applications need the Regular API Key
- ⚠️ Don't delete regular keys (breaks production!)

### Testing Strategy
- Direct API key test first (verify key works)
- Check deployment platform (Vercel/AWS/etc)
- Redeploy to pick up new environment variables
- Test after redeploy to confirm fix

---

## 📞 Support

### If Issues Recur
1. Verify key works: `curl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions...`
2. Check Vercel env vars: `vercel env ls`
3. View logs: `vercel logs --follow`
4. Redeploy: `vercel --prod`

### Monitoring
- OpenRouter Dashboard: https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys
- Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/formul8ai/formul8-multiagent
- GitHub Secrets: https://github.com/F8ai/formul8-multiagent/settings/secrets

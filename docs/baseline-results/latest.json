Review with legal counsel and the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory Commission (CRC) before implementation.)*  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Purpose  \nTo ensure that all movement of licensed cannabis, cannabis products, and related materials **within New Jersey** is performed safely, securely, and in full compliance with the **New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory Commission (CRC) regulations** (N.J. Admin. Code §§ 13:28‑1.1 through 13:28‑5.6) and applicable state statutes.\n\n## 2. Scope  \nApplies to all employees, contractors, and third‑party logistics providers who:\n\n* Transport **cultivation material**, **manufactured product**, **testing samples**, or **waste** between licensed facilities (cultivation, manufacturing, testing, distribution, retail, disposal sites).  \n* Operate **any vehicle** designated for cannabis transport in New Jersey.\n\n## 3.

Below is a quick‑look at the major product groups and the rules that most jurisdictions (U.S. state‑level and Canadian federal) tend to apply to each. If you let me know the specific state or province you’re targeting, I can drill down to exact numbers and statutes.\n\n| Product Type | Key Regulatory Differences | Typical Limits & Requirements |\n|--------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| **Edibles (food, beverages, candies, baked goods)** | • **THC per package** – often capped at 5 mg (U.S.) or 10 mg (Canada) per serving and 10 mg – 100 mg per package.<br>• **Packaging** – must be child‑resistant, opaque, and non‑appealing to children.<br>• **Labeling** – potency, serving size, ingredients, allergens, health warnings, QR code for lab results.<br>• **Testing** – full spectrum for cannabinoids, pesticides, metals, microbial, residual solvents.<br>• **Manufacturing** – food‑grade facilities, Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) or Good Production Practices (GPP). | U.S. (CO, WA, OR, etc.): ≤ 10 mg THC per package, ≤ 5 mg per serving. Canada: ≤ 10 mg THC per package, no per‑serving limit but total ≤ 10 mg. |\n| **Tinctures & Sublingual Drops** | • **THC per bottle** – often limited to 100 mg (U.S.) or 100 mg (Canada) per container.<br>• **Packaging** – child‑resistant dropper bottles; may be clear if dosage is clearly marked.<br>• **Labeling** – potency per mL, total THC, dosage instructions, health warnings.<br>• **Testing** – same as edibles, plus verification of solvent purity (ethanol, CO₂). | Most U.S. states: ≤ 100 mg THC per container. Canada: ≤ 100 mg THC per container; ≤ 10 mg per single‑use dose if marketed as “dose‑specific.” |\n| **Topicals (creams, balms, transdermal patches)** | • **THC limits** – many jurisdictions treat topicals as “non‑psychoactive” and allow higher THC (up to 100 mg or more) because systemic absorption is minimal.<br>• **Packaging** – child‑resistant not always required, but many states still it.<br>• **Labeling** – must list THC/CBD content, intended use, warnings, and batch‑specific lab results.<br>• **Testing** – cannabinoids, pesticides, microbes; for patches, also residual solvent & adhesive safety. | U.S.: Often no THC cap (or up to 100 mg); Canada: ≤ 100 mg THC per package, but no per‑dose limit. |\n| **Vape Cartridges & Concentrates** | • **THC cartridge** – usually capped at 1 g of concentrate with ≤ 100 mg THC (U.S.) or ≤ 100 mg THC per package (Canada).<br>• **Packaging** – child‑resistant, tamper‑evident, opaque, with clear “Do not ingest” warnings.<br>• **Labeling** – potency, net weight, batch number, warning symbols, QR code for lab results.<br>• **Testing** – cannabinoids, residual solvents (especially butane, propane), heavy metals, pesticides, microbial.<br>• **Additional rules** – many states require a “THC‑only” or “THC‑plus‑CBD” designation, and some ban certain additives (e.g., vitamin E acetate). | U.S.: ≤ 100 mg THC per cartridge; Canada: ≤ 100 mg THC per cartridge, ≤ 1 g total weight. |\n| **Capsules & Softgels** | • **THC per capsule** – often limited to 5 mg–10 mg per capsule; package limits similar to edibles (≤ 100 mg total).<br>• **Packaging**\n\n---\n*Agent: F8 Multi-Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1167 (167?1000) | Cost: $0.000000*",

Use it as a checklist while you verify the details for your particular state.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Licensure & Business Structure\n| Requirement | Typical Details |\n|------------|-----------------|\n| **Cannabis/used‑Product License** | Separate licenses are often required for (a) cultivation, (b) processing/manufacturing, and (c) retail. Some states combine processing and manufacturing into a single “infused‑product” license. |\n| **Facility Registration** | Must be a registered “manufacturing” or “processing” site, often subject to zoning, security, and inspection rules. |\n| **Background Checks** | Owners, officers, and key personnel usually undergo criminal‑history screening. |\n| **Ownership Limits** | Many states cap the percentage of ownership that can be held by non‑licensed individuals or entities. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Ingredient & Source Compliance\n| Item | What to Verify |\n|------|----------------|\n| **Cannabis‑Derived Terpenes** | Must be extracted from legally cultivated cannabis that is tracked through the state’s seed‑to‑sale system. |\n| **Botanical‑Derived Terpenes** | Even if the source plant is legal (e.g., lavender, citrus), the terpene isolate may still be regulated as a “controlled substance” if it is chemically identical to a cannabis terpene. Some states require a separate “food‑grade botanical” registration. |\n| **GRAS/USP Status** | For food‑or‑beverage applications, confirm the terpene is recognized as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) or has a USP monograph. |\n| **Supplier Documentation** • COA (Certificate of Analysis) <br>• Batch/lot traceability <br>• Pesticide & heavy‑metal testing results | Required for every incoming batch. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Product Formulation Limits\n| Parameter | Common State Limits |\n|-----------|--------------------|\n| **THC Concentration** | Ranges from 0.3 % (hemp) up to 10 % or higher for “adult‑use” markets. Some states cap per‑serving THC (e.g., 5 mg per edible). |\n| **CBD Concentration** Often unrestricted, but may be capped in “food” categories. |\n| **Total Cannabinoid Load** | Some states limit the combined THC + CBD per package (e.g., ≤ 100 mg). |\n| **Terpene Percentage** | Usually limited to a “flavoring” threshold (e.g., ≤ 5 % of total weight) unless the terpene is considered a “cannabinoid‑derived ingredient.” |\n| **Other Cannabinoids** | Δ‑8‑THC, Δ‑9‑THC‑v, HHC, etc., are frequently prohibited or subject to separate scheduling. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Testing & Quality‑Control\n1. **State‑Approved Lab** – Must submit each batch for mandatory testing (potency, pesticides, residual solvents, heavy metals, microbiology).  \n2. **Certificate of Analysis (COA)** – Must accompany every product lot and be retained for at least 2‑3 years.  \n3. **Stability Testing** – Required for shelf‑life claims; many states ask for a 6‑month accelerated stability protocol.  \n4. **Batch‑Traceability** – QR codes or batch\n\n---\n*Agent: Formulation Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1221 (221?1000) | Cost: $0.000000*",

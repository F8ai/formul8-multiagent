The test panel is usually broader than the flower‑only panel because you now have to verify that the **final‑product potency, contaminants, moisture, and any added components** all meet the state‑mandated limits.\n\nBelow is a practical, step‑by‑step checklist that works for most U.S. state programs (California, Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Massachusetts, etc.).

      "response": "**Short answer:** In most regulated markets you **cannot** ship an infused pre‑roll without a fresh laboratory analysis of the finished product, even if the flower and concentrate you used have already been tested. The act of blending, heating, or otherwise processing those inputs creates a *new* product whose potency, contaminant profile, and stability must be verified.\n\nBelow is a concise breakdown of why retesting is required, the regulatory landscape, and practical steps you can take to keep the testing burden as low as possible while staying compliant.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why the finished pre‑roll is a “new” product\n\n| Factor | How it changes during infusion |\n|--------|--------------------------------|\n| **Potent % (THC, CBD, minor cannabinoids)** | Dilution of concentrate into flower, loss of volatiles during gentle heating, possible decarboxylation differences. |\n| **Terpene profile** | Terpenes can evaporate, oxidize, or redistribute, altering both aroma and perceived potency. |\n| **Residual solvents** | If the concentrate was solvent‑based, any residual solvent can migrate into the flower matrix during mixing/heating. |\n| **Microbial load** | Adding moisture (e.g., from a terpene‑rich concentrate) can raise the water activity of the final roll, potentially supporting mold growth. |\n| **Pesticide / heavy‑metal distribution** | Even if each component is clean, the final blend must be demonstrated to stay below the per‑batch limits set by the state. |\n| **Physical consistency** | Uniformity of dose per joint is a quality‑control issue that regulators often require validated testing for. |\n\nBecause each of those variables can shift, the finished pre‑roll is treated by regulators as a **new batch** that must be independently verified.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Typical regulatory requirements (U.S. state‑level snapshot)\n\n| State | Requirement for “derived” products (e.g., infused pre‑rolls) |\n|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **California** | Every finished product must have a COA covering potency, residual solvents, pesticides, heavy metals, and microbial. Using a “derived product” exemption is only allowed for raw flower that is simply packaged, not for blended products. |\n| **Colorado** | A new COA is required for any product whose composition differs from the source material; potency and contaminants must be tested on the final product. |\n| **Oregon** | Finished products must be tested for potency and contaminants; a “derived product” exemption applies only when the product is **identical** to the tested source (no blending or processing). |\n| **Washington** | All manufactured cannabis products, including infused pre‑rolls, need a fresh COA. |\n| **Illinois** | Mandatory testing of the final product for potency, residual solvents, pesticides, heavy metals, and microbiology. |\n| **Canada (federal)** | A new batch of a manufactured product (e.g., “infused joint”) must be tested for potency, contaminants, and stability; a “source material” COA alone is insufficient. |\n\n**Bottom line:** In the vast majority of jurisdictions, the law treats an infused pre‑roll as a *manufactured cannabis product* and therefore requires a **new laboratory analysis** for each batch.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What testing is typically required for an infused pre‑roll\n\n| Test | Why it matters |\n|------|----------------|\n| **Potency (THC, CBD, minor cannabinoids)** | Confirms the labeled dose per joint and verifies that the blend achieved the target ratio. |\n| **Residual solvents** | Especially important if the concentrate was made with butane, propane, ethanol, CO₂, etc. |\n| **P\n\n---\n*Agent: Formulation Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1181 (181?1000) | Cost: $0.000000*",

A “harvest date” is rarely required on the finished infused product, though some states ask for it on the raw‑cannabis inventory that feeds the infusion process.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the major states say\n\n| State | Required on the final infused product | Harvest date required? | Typical label fields |\n|-------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| **California (Beverage, Edible, Topical, etc.)** | **Manufacture/Production date** (MM/DD/YYYY) **and** “Sell‑by” or “Use‑by” date. | Not required on the consumer label (only on the raw‑cannabis tracking sheet). | Product name, net weight/volume, THC/CBD potency, batch/lot #, QR code, warnings, serving size, allergens, manufacturer info. |\n| **Colorado** | **Manufacture date** (or “Packaging date”) and “Expiration date”. | Not required on the consumer label. | Same as CA plus “Cultivar” (optional) and “Total THC”. |\n| **Oregon** | **Production/Packaging date** and “Expiration date” (must be ≤ 1 yr for edibles). | Not required on the consumer label. | Batch/lot #, potency, allergens, serving size, warnings. |\n| **Washington** | **Production date** (MM/DD/YYYY) and “Expiration date”. | Not required on the consumer label. | Batch/lot #, THC/CBD per serving, warnings, QR code. |\n| **Michigan** | **Manufacturing date** and “Best‑by” date. | Not required on the consumer label. | Batch/lot, potency, warnings, allergens. |\n| **Massachusetts** | **Manufacture date** and “Expiration date”. | Not required on the consumer label. | Batch/lot #, potency, warnings, serving size. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** All of the states above (the ones with the most mature markets) require a *production/manufacture/packaging* date on the consumer‑facing label.

What Sets the Upper Limit?\n\n1. **Regulatory ceilings** – Most states/countries set a per‑serving THC limit (10 mg is common). Exceeding it makes the product illegal for retail.\n2. **Formulation physics** – THC and CBD are lipophilic; they dissolve best in fats. A typical oil or butter can hold ~5 % w/w total cannabinoids before the mixture becomes gritty or separates.\n3. **Safety & consumer tolerance** – Doses >30 mg THC can cause anxiety, tachycardia, or severe impairment in naïve users. Professional guidance and clear labeling are mandatory.\n4. **Stability** – High cannabinoid loads increase the risk of oxidation. Antioxidants (e.g., tocopherols) and opaque, airtight packaging become essential.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Quick “How‑Much” Calculator\n\nAssume you’re making 1 kg of chocolate ganache using a 5 % w/w total cannabinoid load (all THC for simplicity).\n\n| Step | Calculation | Result |\n|------|-------------|--------|\n| Desired THC % | 5 % w/w | 0.05 kg THC = **50 g** |\n| Convert to mg | 50 g × 1,000 mg/g | **50,000 mg THC** |\n| Servings per batch | 1 kg ÷ 20 g per piece (typical bar) | 50 pieces |\n| THC per serving | 50,000 mg ÷ 50 | **1,000 mg** (far above any legal limit) |\n\n**Real‑world adjustment:** To hit a legal 10 mg/serving target, you’d only need **0.5 % w/w** THC (≈10 g THC in the 1 kg batch).  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Practical Tips for Maximizing Potency While Staying Safe\n\n| Tip | Why it matters |\n|-----|----------------|\n| **Use high‑purity distillate or isolate** (≥95 % THC) | Reduces bulk volume needed, improves homogeneity, and eases dosing calculations. |\n| **Emulsify with lecithin or polysorbate‑80** | Improves cannabinoid dispersion, allowing higher loading without grainy texture. |\n| **Add antioxidants (e.g., vitamin E, rosemary extract)** | Slows oxidation, preserving potency over the product’s shelf life. |\n| **Standardize batch testing** | Run HPLC‑UV/FL\n\n---\n*Agent: Formulation Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1202 (202?1000) | Cost: $0.000000*",

Any spark, static discharge, or leak while the system is pressurized can cause fire or explosion. |\n| **Regulatory compliance** | Most state cannabis‑extraction regulations (e.g., California B&C, Colorado, Massachusetts) require a **Lock‑Out/Tag‑Out (LOTO)** procedure and a “no‑work‑while‑running” rule for HC equipment. |\n| **Product integrity** | Running the extractor while you’re fiddling with seals, valves, or pumps can introduce contaminants, cause pressure spikes, and affect solvent recovery yields. |\n| **Equipment protection** | Moving parts (pumps, rotary valves, heat exchangers) are designed for continuous operation under specific loads. Unplanned intervention can cause premature wear or catastrophic failure. |\n| **Insurance & liability** | Performing work on a live HC system often voids insurance coverage and can expose the facility to workers‑comp claims. |\n\n---\n\n### What *is* permissible during operating hours\n| Activity | Conditions |\n|----------|------------|\n| **Visual inspections** (e.g., checking gauge readings, looking for leaks, confirming coolant flow) | No tools or adjustments; maintain a safe distance; wear proper PPE. |\n| **Data logging / software checks** | Can be done on the HMI or remote interface without touching hardware. |\n| **Minor, non‑intrusive tasks** (e.g., swapping a pre‑qualified filter cartridge that is designed for “hot‑swap”) | Only if the equipment’s SOP explicitly allows it and the system is in a **safe‑state** (pressure relieved, solvent recirculating, LOTO applied). |\n| **Emergency shutdown** | If a safety alarm triggers, you *must* stop the extractor and follow the emergency LOTO procedure before any work. |\n\n---\n\n### Recommended best‑practice workflow\n\n1. **Plan** – Schedule all preventive‑maintenance, cleaning, and part‑replacement tasks during a **planned production downtime** or a dedicated “maintenance window.”\n2. **Notify** – Alert production, quality, and safety teams at least 24 h in advance.\n3. **Lock‑Out/Tag‑Out** – Depressurize the system, purge residual solvent, isolate power and fluid lines, and apply LOTO devices per SOP.\n4. **Verify** – Perform a “zero‑energy” check (e.g., verify no pressure, no voltage) before starting work.\n5. **Document** – Record the maintenance activity, any observations, and sign‑off by a qualified technician and a safety officer.\n6. **Re‑commission** – After work, perform a leak test, purge, and run a short trial run before returning to full production.\n\n---\n\n### Quick checklist for “Can I do it now?”\n\n| Question | Yes/No | Note |\n|----------|--------|------|\n| Is the extractor **pressurized** or **solvent‑filled**? | **No** | Must be depressurized and purged. |\n| Does the SOP list this task as a **“hot‑swap”**? | **Yes** (and all safety steps followed) | Proceed with LOTO. |\n| Is there a **critical production need** that outweighs safety? | **Never** | Safety always trumps production. |\n| Are all **PPE, LOTO, and permits** in place? | **Yes** | Still prefer to schedule during downtime. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n- **Major maintenance = shut down the extractor.**  \n- **Minor, pre‑approved “hot‑swap” tasks** may be done if the system is in a safe, locked‑out state.  \n- Always follow your facility’s SOPs, state regulations, and LOTO procedures.\n\nIf you need a specific SOP template or help building a maintenance schedule that aligns with your production cycle, let me know and I can route you to a specialized compliance or operations agent.\n\n---\n*Agent: F8 Multi-Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1152 (167?985) | Cost: $0.000000*",

Regulatory framework that governs the question  \n\n| Jurisdiction | Key Requirement for Multiple Methods |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------|\n| **U.S. State licences** (e.g., CA, CO, MA, OR) | Most states issue a single “manufacturing” or “extraction” licence that covers *all* extraction techniques the lab is authorized to use. The licence will list the approved methods (e.g., super‑critical CO₂, ethanol, hydrocarbon). Running more than one method is permissible **if** each method is listed on the licence and you follow the state‑approved SOPs. |\n| **Federal (US)** | Cannabis remains a Schedule I substance, so “federal compliance” is limited to research‑only activities under a DEA registration. For a DEA‑registered research lab, the same rule applies – each method must be described in the IND/IND‑type protocol and validated. |\n| **Canada (Health Canada)** | A single “Cannabis Processing Licence” can cover multiple extraction processes, but the licence holder must *document* each process in its GMP‑style SOPs, perform risk assessments, and keep separate batch records. |\n| **EU (e.g., Netherlands, Spain)** | Licences are typically activity‑specific.

A new package that will leave the original bulk container enters a new “node” in that chain, so it needs its own identifier. |\n| **Testing & compliance** | Each retail‑ready package must be linked to a specific test result (potency, contaminants, etc.). A UID ties that result to the exact product that the consumer purchases. |\n| **Consumer safety & recall** | If a problem is discovered, regulators can quickly pinpoint *which* package(s) are affected. A single UID on the bulk container would not give that granularity. |\n| **State statutes** | Most state statutes explicitly state that “any repackaging of a cannabis product for sale shall be assigned a new UID” (e.g., CO Regulation § 13‑1‑802, CA BPC § 14024, MA Reg. 202‑4). |\n\n---\n\n### When a new UID **might NOT** be needed\n\n| Situation | Note |\n|-----------|------|\n| **Internal use only** (e.g., sample for lab work, employee training) | If the repackaged portion never enters the commercial supply chain, many states allow it to remain under the original UID, but you must document the internal transfer. |\n| **Portioning for the same retail package** (e.g., a “multi‑dose” bottle with separate syringes that stay sealed together) | If the smaller units are never sold *independently* and remain physically attached to the original container, the original UID can stay. |\n| **State‑specific exemptions** | Some states (e.g., Oregon’s “bulk‑to‑retail” exemption for licensed manufacturers) permit a limited number of repackaging events without new UIDs, but only under a documented “repackage” transaction in the seed‑to‑sale software. Always verify the exact wording. |\n\n---\n\n### Practical steps to stay compliant\n\n1. **Log the repackaging event** in your seed‑to‑track system (e.g., METRC, BioTrackTHC, etc.).  \n   - Record the bulk‑oil UID as the “source.”  \n   - Generate a new UID for each new container.\n\n2. **Attach the new UID label** before the product leaves the repackaging area.  \n   - Labels must meet all state requirements (barcode, QR code, product name, potency, batch/lot, etc.).\n\n3. **Link test results** to the new UID(s). If the original bulk test covers the entire lot, you can propagate that result, but the system must reflect the relationship.\n\n4. **Maintain documentation** (photos, SOPs, batch records) showing the bulk container, the repackaging process, and the new labels. This is crucial for audits.\n\n5. **Check state‑specific guidance**:  \n   - **California** – BPC § 14024 requires a new “Package ID” for every retail package.  \n   - **Colorado** – Reg. § 13‑1‑802 mandates a new “Package ID” for each repackaged unit.  \n   - **Massachusetts** – Reg. § 202‑4‑2.1 states that each “saleable package” must have a unique identifier.\n\n6.\n\n---\n*Agent: F8 Multi-Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1167 (167?1000) | Cost: $0.000000*",

      "response": "**Short answer:** In a regulated market you should **not release (sell or distribute) pre‑filled vape cartridges until a full COA (Certificate of Analysis) confirming potency, contaminants, and terpene profile is on file and the batch is officially cleared.**  \n\nBelow is a quick compliance checklist and the rationale behind it.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why the COA must precede release\n\n| Requirement | Typical Regulator | What the COA proves |\n|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| **Potency verification** (THC/CBD) | State cannabis boards (e.g., CA BCC, CO MED) / Health Canada | Product is labeled accurately; prevents over‑/under‑dosing. |\n| **Contaminant limits** (pesticides, heavy metals, residual solvents, microbiology) | Same as above; many adopt ISO‑17025 labs | Guarantees safety; non‑compliance can trigger recalls, fines, or license suspension. |\n| **Terpene profile (optional but often required)** | Some states (e.g., Oregon, Massachusetts) | Supports “full‑spectrum” claims and helps with batch traceability. |\n| **Shelf‑life & stability data** | GMP/ISO‑9001 audits | Confirms the product will remain within specs through its labeled shelf life. |\n\nA COA is the **legal evidence** that the batch meets all statutory limits. Until it is received, the batch is considered **“in‑process”** and cannot be released for consumer use.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Typical regulatory language (examples)\n\n- **California (BCC § 5605‑5):** “No cannabis product shall be sold or otherwise transferred to a consumer until the product has been tested by a licensed laboratory and the results have been entered into the track‑and‑trace system.”\n- **Colorado (C.R.S. 13‑300‑1202):** “Manufacturers may not package or label a product for sale until the product has passed a laboratory test and a COA has been uploaded to the state’s tracking system.”\n- **Canada (Cannabis Act & Regulations):** “A product may not be sold unless a valid analytical test report confirming compliance with the limits set out in the regulations is on file.”\n\nThe language is consistent: **testing → COA → release**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What you *can* do while waiting for the COA\n\n| Activity | Status |\n|----------|--------|\n| **Internal QC sampling** (e.g., weight, visual inspection, in‑house potency checks) | ✅ Allowed – helps catch gross errors before lab submission. |\n| **Batch segregation & secure storage** | ✅ Required – keep “test‑pending” product separate from cleared inventory. |\n| **Provisional labeling** (e.g., “Laboratory results pending”) | ❌ Not permitted for consumer‑facing packaging; only internal work‑order labels are acceptable. |\n| **Limited “pre‑fill” for internal validation** (e.g., a small pilot run for equipment qualification) | ✅ If the product is **not** placed into commerce and is clearly marked as “QC sample – not for sale.” |\n| **Release to a third‑party testing lab** | ✅ Must be done under a chain‑of‑custody agreement; the lab’s receipt is the trigger for the testing workflow. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Risks of releasing before COA\n\n| Risk | Consequence |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Regulatory enforcement** (fines, license suspension, product seizure) | Financial loss, brand damage. |\n| **Consumer safety** (undetected solvent residues, microbial contamination) | Liability lawsuits, recalls. |\n| **Labeling inaccuracies** (THC/CBD potency off‑by >10 %) | Mis‑dosing, medical/legal complaints. |\n| **Batch traceability breakdown** | Inability to perform a targeted recall if needed. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Practical workflow you can adopt\n\n1. **Batch creation → Weigh & record** (electronic batch record).  \n2. **Submit sealed sample to accredited lab** (maintain chain‑of‑custody).  \n3. **Place the entire batch in “Quarantine/Testing Pending”** status in your ERP/WMS.  \n4. **Perform internal QC** (visual, weight\n\n---\n*Agent: Formulation Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1210 (210?1000) | Cost: $0.000000*",

Unrecorded loss is considered a discrepancy. |\n| **Traceability** | Accurate batch records enable you to trace every gram back to its origin, which is essential for recalls, audits, and QA investigations. |\n| **Inventory reconciliation** | Your perpetual inventory must balance. Spillage that isn’t recorded will cause a “missing” variance at close‑out. |\n| **Potency & cost calculations** | Net weight is used to calculate batch potency, cost of goods sold (COGS), and pricing. An inflated weight skews these numbers. |\n| **Audit readiness** | Auditors will look for a documented **Waste/Loss Log** and a matching adjustment in the batch record. Missing entries are red‑flags. |\n\n---\n\n### How to handle spillage in the system\n\n1. **Measure the loss**  \n   - Weigh the container before and after the spill (or use the scale that recorded the original batch weight).  \n   - Record the exact amount lost (e.g., 0.075 lb or 34 g).\n\n2. **Document the event**  \n   - **Who** performed the operation.  \n   - **When** (date & time).  \n   - **Where** (production line, workstation).  \n   - **Why** (e.g., “container tip‑over”, “transfer error”).  \n   - **What** was lost (product type, strain, batch number).  \n   - **How much** (weight).  \n   - Attach a photo incident report if required by SOP.\n\n3. **Enter the loss in the batch record**  \n   - Most seed‑to‑sale or ERP systems have a **“Waste/Loss”** or **“Adjustments”** tab.  \n   - Add a line item: *Spillage – 34 g – Reason: Transfer error – Approved by QA*.  \n   - The system will automatically recalculate **Net Batch Weight** = *Gross Weight – Recorded Loss*.\n\n4. **Update inventory**  \n   - Reduce the on‑hand inventory of the affected SKU by the loss amount.  \n   - If you use a separate **Waste Inventory** location, move the weight there for proper costing.\n\n5. **Quality/Compliance sign‑off**  \n   - Have the QA manager review and sign off the adjustment.  \n   - If the loss exceeds your **tolerance threshold** (commonly 0.5 %–1 % of batch size), trigger a root‑cause analysis and possibly a corrective‑preventive action (CAPA).\n\n6. **Close‑out reconciliation**  \n   - At batch completion, ensure the **final net weight** matches the weight recorded in the system after all adjustments (including spillage).  \n   - Any discrepancy > 0.1 % should be investigated before the batch can be released.\n\n---\n\n### Quick checklist for a spillage event\n\n- [ ] Measure and record the exact weight lost.  \n- [ ] Log the incident in the batch record’s waste/adjustment section.  \n- [ ] Update net batch weight automatically (or manually if your system requires).  \n- [ ] Adjust inventory levels accordingly.  \n- [ ] Obtain QA/Compliance sign\n\n---\n*Agent: F8 Multi-Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1171 (171?1000) | Cost: $0.000000*",

Let's make sure to cover all bases when it comes to re-packaging!**Considering product re-packaging** When re-packaging, it's important to think about whether we need to conduct a finished product test. This is especially true if the product has been infused or modified, or if the changes affect the net weight unit. Those aspects might require verifying homogeneity or potency at the package level. It sounds like a crucial step to ensure we meet quality and regulatory standards effectively!"

      "response": "**Short answer:** In most U.S. cannabis‑regulatory programs you can share laboratory results **before** the product is fully packaged, but you must follow the specific submission rules of the state (or tribal) authority that governs you. If you miss a required step—such as final labeling, batch identification, or a “finished‑goods” certification—your submission may be rejected or delayed.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the regulations usually require\n\n| Jurisdiction | Typical requirement for test‑result submission |\n|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| **California (CDEA/Bureau of Cannabis Control)** | Lab results must be attached to the **Finished‑Goods Certificate (FGC)**, which is generated *after* packaging and labeling. Early submission is allowed only as a “pre‑review” (no official acceptance). |\n| **Colorado (CDSA)** | Test results are entered into the **Track‑and‑Trace (METRC)** system once the **batch is created** (which occurs at packaging). Early upload is not permitted. |\n| **Oregon (ORS‑DOH)** | Lab reports can be uploaded to the **Oregon Cannabis Tracking System (OCTS)** before packaging, but the final **Certificate of Analysis (COA)** must be attached to the finished‑goods record. |\n| **Washington (LCA)** | Results must be linked to a **product lot** that is created at the point of packaging. Early submission is only for “pre‑approval” of the testing lab, not the product. |\n| **Tribal/Other states** | Varies widely; many require the COA to be submitted *after* the packaging label is finalized. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** Most states tie the COA/FGC to a *finished‑goods* record that is created at packaging. Submitting results beforehand is usually allowed only as a *pre‑review* or for internal quality‑control purposes—not as the official regulator‑accepted document.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why you might want to share early\n\n| Reason | Benefit | Caveat |\n|--------|---------|--------|\n| **Expedite market entry** | Regulators can begin a preliminary review, reducing the time between packaging and final release. | Must still submit the final COA/FGC once packaging is complete. |\n| **Identify failures early** | Lab can flag potency or contaminants before you invest in packaging material. | Early results may change after re��testing of the final packaged batch. |\n| **Demonstrate compliance to partners** | Distributors or retailers may request lab data before they accept inventory. | They usually request the *final* COA tied to the lot number. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Steps to safely submit test results before packaging\n\n1. **Confirm the jurisdiction’s rulebook**  \n   - Look up the “Laboratory Testing” or “Product Certification” section of your state’s cannabis code (e.g., CCPA § 7300‑7350 for California).  \n   - Identify whether the regulator permits a *pre‑submission* or *pre‑review* of raw‑material test results.\n\n2. **Use the proper electronic portal**  \n   - Most states have a Track‑and‑Trace system (METRC, OCTS, CannaReg, etc.).  \n   - Create a **“pre‑batch”** or **“raw‑material”** record if the system offers it, and attach the lab PDF/JSON file.\n\n3. **Label the submission clearly**  \n   - Add a note such as “**Pre‑Packaging Test Results – Subject to Change**”.  \n   - Include the **sample ID**, **date of collection**, **lab accreditation number**, and **testing method**.\n\n4. **Maintain chain‑of‑custody documentation**  \n   - Keep the original lab certificate, the sample’s chain‑of‑custody form, and any internal QA notes.  \n   - If the regulator asks for the *original* COA later, you’ll have it ready.\n\n5. **Plan for a follow‑up submission**  \n   - Once packaging is complete, generate the **Finished‑Goods Certificate (or equivalent)** and attach the *final* COA.  \n   - Reference the pre‑submission ID so the regulator can link the two records.\n\n6. **Notify the regulator (if required)**  \n   - Some states require a brief email or portal message indicating “pre‑submission of test results pending packaging.”  \n   - Keep a copy of that communication for audit trails.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Risks of premature submission\n\n| Risk | Mitigation |\n|------|------------|\n| **Regulatory rejection** – The portal may not accept a COA without a batch/lot ID. | Verify the system’s “pre‑batch” option first; if none, wait until packaging. |\n| **Mis‑aligned data** – Potency can shift after packaging (e.g., due to moisture loss). | Re‑test a **post‑packaging sample** and attach that as the final COA. |\n| **Confidentiality breach** – Early sharing may expose formulation details. | Use secure, encrypted upload and limit access to regulator‑only users. |\n| **Audit complications** – Auditors may question why two COAs exist for the same product. | Keep a clear audit trail showing the pre‑submission was for *pre‑review only* and was superseded by the final COA. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Quick “Decision Tree”\n\n1. **Is your state’s regulator allowing pre‑submission?**  \n   - **Yes** → Use the portal’s “pre‑batch”/“raw‑material” record, label as provisional, and follow steps 2‑6.  \n   - **No** → Hold the lab results until you create the finished‑goods record (post‑packaging) and submit then.\n\n2. **Do you need the data now for a business partner?**  \n   - Provide a **private copy** of the lab report (with a disclaimer) *outside* the regulator’s system, while keeping the official submission pending.\n\n3. **Is the product already in a “batch” (even if unfilled)?**  \n   - If your software creates a batch at the **raw‑material stage**, you can attach the COA to that batch and later merge/replace it with the final batch record.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Bottom‑line recommendation\n\n- **Check your state’s specific rulebook** (or tribal code) first.  \n- If the regulator’s portal supports a provisional or “pre‑batch” entry, you may upload the test results now—**but always flag them as provisional** and be prepared to submit the final COA once packaging is complete.  \n- If no such provision exists, **wait** until you have a finished‑goods record; otherwise you risk rejection or audit findings.  \n\nWhen in doubt, a brief email to the regulator’s compliance liaison (e.g., “Can we submit the current lab report as a pre‑review before packaging is finalized?”) is often the safest route.  \n\n---\n\n**Next steps for you**\n\n1. Identify your jurisdiction’s tracking system (METRC, OCTS, etc.).  \n2. Look up the “Laboratory Testing” section of the state code.  \n3. If permissible, create a pre‑batch record and upload the lab PDF with a “provisional” note.  \n4. Schedule a re‑test after packaging to generate the final COA.  \n\nFeel free to share which state you’re operating in, and I can point you to the exact rule citation or portal instructions.\n\n---\n*Agent: F8 Multi-Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1838 (165?1673) | Cost: $0.000000*",

The law typically mandates that it be rendered **non‑recoverable** before disposal. |\n| **Prevent diversion** | Mixing with non‑consumable waste (e.g., ash, paper, wood chips) ensures the material can’t be re‑processed or reclaimed for consumption. |\n| **Environmental safety** | Proper mixing or treatment (incineration, composting under regulated conditions) reduces the risk of contaminating soil or water. |\n| **Record‑keeping** | Many states require a **waste‑disposal log** that notes the mixing process, quantity, date, and disposal vendor. |\n\n---\n\n### Common accepted disposal methods\n\n| Method | How it meets the “mixing” requirement | Typical steps |\n|--------|----------------------------------------|---------------|\n| **Incineration** (licensed waste‑to‑energy facility) | Biomass is combusted at high temperature, destroying THC and other cannabinoids. | 1. Package biomass in approved containers 2. Ship to licensed incinerator 3. Obtain destruction certificate. |\n| **Composting (regulated)** | Biomass is blended with a large volume of organic waste (e.g., yard trimmings) to dilute cannabinoid content below detectable levels. Some states require a **minimum 1:10 ratio**. | 1. Mix with non‑consumable organic material 2. Compost in a licensed facility 3. Test final product if required. |\n| **Landfill (sealed, non‑hazardous)** | When mixed with inert waste (e.g., construction debris, ash) the material is classified as **non‑recoverable**. | 1. Combine biomass with at least 50 % inert waste 2. Seal in a landfill‑approved container 3.

      "response": "**Short answer:** No – cannabis‑related waste (plant material, trim, contaminated consumables, etc.) must be kept *separate* from ordinary laboratory trash, even if you only need to store it for a short period. Mixing the two can put you out of compliance with state regulations, fire‑safety rules, and hazardous‑waste requirements.\n\n---\n\n## Why the waste must be kept separate\n\n| Reason | How it applies to cannabis waste |\n|--------|----------------------------------|\n| **State‑mandated tracking** | Most states (e.g., CA, CO, WA, OR, MA) require that all cannabis waste be **identified, weighed, and logged** from the moment it leaves the production area until it is destroyed. Mixing it with regular trash defeats that chain‑of‑custody. |\n| **Security & diversion prevention** | Cannabis waste is a **controlled substance**. Regulations often demand **locked, tamper‑evident containers** and limited access to prevent theft or diversion. |\n| **Fire‑hazard considerations** | Dried plant material is highly combustible. Storing it with other combustibles (paper, plastics) can increase fire risk and may violate local fire‑code or OSHA standards. |\n| **Environmental & hazardous‑waste rules** | Some cannabis waste (e.g., solvent‑soaked rags, contaminated PPE) may be classified as **hazardous waste**. Hazardous waste must be stored in **designated, labeled containers** separate from municipal trash. |\n| **Regulatory inspections** | Inspectors look for **segregated waste streams**. A single mixed bin is a common citation trigger and can lead to fines or a loss of license. |\n\n---\n\n## What “temporarily” means in practice\n\n| Situation | Acceptable? | What you must do |\n|-----------|------------|------------------|\n| **Putting a sealed, labeled cannabis‑waste bag in a separate, locked bin that sits next to the general trash bin** | **Yes** – as long as the cannabis waste stays in its own container and the container is secured. |\n| **Throwing loose trim or contaminated gloves directly into the same municipal trash can** | **No** – the waste is no longer identifiable or secured. |\n| **Storing a small amount of waste in a dedicated, clearly labeled “Cannabis Waste” tote that is kept in the same room as the regular trash** | **Yes** – provided the tote is **locked (or at least tamper‑evident), labeled, and the waste is logged**. |\n| **Leaving cannabis waste in an open box on a bench next to the regular trash for a few hours** | **No** – it is not secured, not labeled, and not logged. |\n\nIn short, *the only thing that can be shared* is **the physical space** (the same room or storage closet). The waste streams themselves must **never be co‑mixed**.\n\n---\n\n## How to store cannabis waste correctly (even for a short‑term)\n\n1. **Use a dedicated container**  \n   * Heavy‑duty, sealable tote or drum (often 55 gal).  \n   * Must be **clearly labeled** (“CANNABIS WASTE – DO NOT MIX”) with the date and weight (if required).  \n\n2. **Secure the container**  \n   * Lock it or use a tamper‑evident seal.  \n   * Limit access to authorized personnel only (key‑card, lock, or combination).  \n\n3. **Log every addition**  \n   * Record: date, time, weight (or volume), source (e.g., “trim from extraction line”), and person adding it.  \n   * Most states require a **waste‑tracking spreadsheet or software** that can be produced on request.  \n\n4. **Maintain temperature & fire safety**  \n   * Store in a **cool, dry area** away from open flames, heat sources, and direct sunlight.  \n   * If the waste is solvent‑soaked, store in a **flammable‑liquid cabinet** per OSHA 1910.106.  \n\n5. **Arrange for licensed disposal**  \n   * Contact a state‑approved waste\n\n---\n*Agent: F8 Multi-Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1135 (135?1000) | Cost: $0.000000*",

The exact requirement—who can act as that second person, what documentation is needed, and how it must be stored—varies by state (and sometimes by local municipality), so you’ll need to confirm the specifics for your license.\n\n---\n\n## Why a second person is required\n\n| Reason | Typical regulatory language |\n|--------|-----------------------------|\n| **Accountability** | “All waste must be destroyed in the presence of a second authorized individual and documented on a waste manifest.” |\n| **Chain‑of‑custody** | “The waste generator and the waste destroyer must each sign the manifest; a witness may be required for verification.” |\n| **Prevent diversion** | “A second person shall verify that no viable product remains after destruction.” |\n| **Audit trail** | “Records must be retained for X years and be available for inspection by the regulator.” |\n\nThe “second person” is usually defined as someone **not directly involved in the generation of the waste** (e.g., a manager, compliance officer, or a representative from an approved disposal contractor). In many states the second person must be a **licensed employee** or an **authorized third‑party witness**.\n\n---\n\n## Common State Practices (illustrative)\n\n| State | Who can be the “second person”? | Documentation |\n|-------|--------------------------------|----------------|\n| **California (B&C)** | Any **licensed employee** not directly handling the waste, or a **licensed disposal contractor** representative. | B&C‑018 “Waste Disposal Log” + signed manifest. |\n| **Colorado** | **Compliance officer** or **senior manager** not involved in the production line. | CO‑06 “Waste Destruction Form” with two signatures. |\n| **Oregon** | **Licensed “Waste Destroyer”** plus a **witness** (often a manager). | OR‑08 “Cannabis Waste Manifest” – three signatures (generator, destroyer, witness). |\n| **Washington** | **Authorized “Second Person”** defined in the license; can be a **third‑party auditor**. | WA‑04 “Waste Destruction Report” – dual sign‑off required. |\n| **Michigan** | **Compliance/Operations Manager** or an **external auditor**. | MI‑07abis Waste Log” – two signatures required. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** If your state follows the typical model, you’ll need a second authorized individual to **witness** the destruction and **sign** the waste manifest/log.\n\n---\n\n## Typical Steps to Satisfy the Requirement\n\n1. **Generate a Waste Manifest** (or log) at the time waste is set aside for disposal.\n2. **Select an authorized second person**  \n   - Internal: compliance officer, senior manager, or designated “waste supervisor.”  \n   - External: representative of an approved disposal contractor, third‑party auditor, or licensed waste destroyer.\n3. **Conduct the destruction** (e.g., incineration, chemical neutralization, rendering).  \n   - The second person must be **present** (or view video evidence) while the waste is destroyed.\n4. **Co‑sign the manifest**  \n   - Both the waste generator and the second person sign (hand‑written or electronic, per state‑approved method).  \n   - Include the date, time, method, and quantity destroyed.\n5. **Attach supporting evidence** (photos, video, disposal‑service receipt).  \n6. **Store records** for the retention period mandated by your state (often 3–5 years).  \n7. **Make records available** for regulator inspection or audit.\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Follow‑Ups\n\n| Question | Quick Answer |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Can the same person sign twice?** | No. Regulations require *independent* verification.

Below is a practical checklist to make sure the intern’s shadowing is compliant and safe.\n\n---\n\n## 1️⃣ Legal & Licensing Check\n| Item | What to verify |\n|------|----------------|\n| **State/Provincial cannabis licence** | The extraction area must be covered by a licensed “manufacturing/processing” permit. Some licences explicitly restrict who may be present during extraction. |\n| **Labor laws** | Verify that the intern is classified correctly (e.g., student, trainee, employee) and that any required work‑study or apprenticeship agreements are in place. |\n| **Background checks** | Many jurisdictions require all personnel with access to controlled‑substance areas to pass a criminal‑background screening. |\n| **Confidentiality / NDA** | If you handle proprietary formulations or COAs, have the intern sign a non‑disclosure agreement before entry. |\n| **Age requirement** | The intern must meet the minimum age for handling controlled substances (typically ≥ 21 y/o in most U.S. states). |\n\n---\n\n## 2️⃣ Safety & Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)\n| Requirement | Details |\n|-------------|---------|\n| **Supervision** | A qualified, licensed extraction technician must be in the same line of sight at all times. |\n| **PPE** | Lab coat, flame‑resistant coveralls, safety goggles, nitrile gloves, and a face shield when volatilizing solvents. |\n| **Ventilation** | Ensure the extraction hood/vent system is operating at ≥ 100 cfm per 1 g of solvent used. |\n| **Emergency training** | Review fire‑extinguishing (CO₂, dry‑chemical), spill‑response, and first‑aid procedures before entry. |\n| **Chemical handling** | Provide a brief on MSDS for all solvents (e.g., ethanol, butane, CO₂) and any hazardous reagents. |\n\n---\n\n## 3️⃣ Operational Controls\n1. **Written SOP for “Intern Shadowing”** – Include entry/exit logs, PPE checklist, and a sign‑off sheet for the supervising technician.  \n2. **Limited access** – Restrict the intern to observation only; no hands‑on manipulation of solvents, pressurised equipment, or live controls.  \n3. **Documentation** – Record the date, time, supervisor name, and intern name in the batch record or a separate training log.  \n4. **Camera/recording policy** – If you allow video, ensure it does not capture proprietary processes and that the intern signs a media‑release/ confidentiality addendum.  \n\n---\n\n## 4️⃣ Training Prior to the Session\n| Topic | Minimum competency |\n|-------|---------------------|\n| **Basic cannabis extraction theory** | Understand the difference between solvent‑based, CO₂, and rosin methods. |\n| **Safety orientation** | Identify emergency exits, fire extinguishers, eyewash stations. |\n| **PPE donning / doffing** | Demonstrate correct sequence without contaminating the cleanroom. |\n| **Regulatory awareness** | Know the key points of your state’s cannabis manufacturing regulations. |\n\nA short “pre‑flight” quiz (5–10 questions) can serve as proof of comprehension before the intern is granted entry.\n\n---\n\n## 5️⃣ After‑Session Follow‑Up\n- **Debrief** with the supervising technician to address any safety observations.  \n- **Feedback form** for the intern to capture learning points and any concerns.  \n- **Update training records** to reflect completion of the shadowing activity.  \n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n- **Yes, you can let an intern shadow** a live extraction **provided** you have:\n  - A valid extraction licence that permits trainees,\n  - Completed background and age checks,\n  - Signed NDAs/confidentiality agreements,\n  - Full PPE and safety briefings,\n  - A documented SOP and supervisor present at all times.\n\nIf any of these elements are missing, hold off until they’re in place to avoid regulatory penalties, safety incidents, or intellectual‑property exposure\n\n---\n*Agent: Formulation Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1206 (206?1000) | Cost: $0.000000*",

Verify Licensing & Permits\n| Requirement | What to check |\n|-------------|---------------|\n| **Sender’s license** | Must be a licensed **processor/extractor** authorized to produce crude oil. |\n| **Receiver’s license** | Must hold a **manufacturing/processing** license that permits receipt of uncured extracts. |\n| **Transporter’s registration** | Some states require a separate “transport‑only” permit or that the carrier be a licensed **carrier** (e.g., a “cannabis transport license”). |\n| **Inter‑state/ inter‑province** | If crossing state/provincial borders, confirm that both jurisdictions allow the movement of raw extracts and that any required **inter‑jurisdictional agreements** are in place. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Chain‑of‑Custody Documentation\n1. **Batch Record** – Assign a unique batch/lot number at the point of extraction.  \n2. **Transfer Manifest** – Include:  \n   * Batch number, weight, and volume of crude oil  \n   * Date & time of shipment  \n   * Names/addresses of sender & receiver  \n   * Authorized signatories (both sites)  \n   * Vehicle ID & driver name/license number  \n3. **Certificate of Analysis (COA) Stub** – Even though final testing hasn’t occurred, attach the **pre‑test COA** (e.g., potency, residual solvent screen) that was generated at the extraction lab.  \n4. **Receiving Acknowledgment** – Receiver signs a receipt confirming quantity, condition, and that the material is “untested crude oil.”\n\n*Keep all paperwork in both electronic (ERP/track‑and‑trace) and hard‑copy formats for at least the retention period required by your regulator (often 2–3 years).*\n\n---\n\n## 3. Packaging & Labeling\n| Requirement | Details |\n|-------------|---------|\n| **Primary container** | Use sealed, tamper‑evident, food‑grade containers (e.g., amber HDPE or stainless steel). |\n| **Secondary packaging** | Leak‑proof, crush‑resistant boxes with absorbent pads. |\n| **Label** | Must read **“CRUDE CANNABIS EXTRACT – NOT FOR CONSUMPTION – UNTESTED – KEEP REFRIGERATED (if required)”** plus batch number, weight, and the sender/receiver IDs. |\n| **Material safety data sheet (MSDS)** | Provide if the extract contains solvents (e.g., butane, ethanol) or is classified as hazardous. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Temperature & Stability Controls\n* **Cold‑chain** – Many crude oils degrade above 25 °C; use insulated containers or refrigerated trucks if required by your state’s stability guidelines.  \n* **Light protection** – Amber or opaque containers reduce terpene loss.  \n* **Shelf‑life tracking** – Record the “time‑in‑transit” and add it to the overall age of the batch for later stability calculations.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Security & Transportation Rules\n| Rule | Typical requirement |\n|------|----------------------|\n| **Vehicle security** | Locked cargo area, GPS tracking, and driver background check. |\n| **Driver qualification** | Must have a valid commercial driver’s license (CDL) and, in many states, a **cannabis‑transport endorsement**. |\n| **Route planning** | Pre‑approved route; avoid public highways where possible if required by your regulator. |\n| **Incident reporting** | Immediate written report to both state agencies and your compliance officer if a spill, loss, or theft occurs. |\n\n---\n\n## 6.

Why states impose a transporter requirement\n\n| Reason | What it means for you |\n|--------|----------------------|\n| **Track‑and‑trace** (METRC, BioTrackTHC, etc.) | Every “move” must be recorded on the state’s seed‑to‑sale system, and the system only accepts moves that are performed by a **registered transport license**. |\n| **Security & public safety** | Transporters must meet vehicle, driver‑training, and cargo‑security standards (e.g., locked containers, GPS, 24‑hr video). |\n| **Taxation** | Some states levy a separate excise tax at the point of transport; the transporter’s license is the legal entity that remits it. |\n| **Inter‑agency oversight | Law‑enforcement and the state cannabis board can audit the transporter’s manifest to verify compliance. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Typical state rules (2024‑2025 snapshot)\n\n| State | In‑state transport needed? | Common exceptions |\n|-------|---------------------------|-------------------|\n| **California (B&C)** | **Yes** – a *Transporter License* (or a “transport endorsement” on a cultivation/retail license) is required for any movement outside the originating licensed premises. | Moves that stay within a single “licensed campus” (e.g., grow → on‑) do not need a separate transporter. |\n| **Colorado** | **Yes** – a *Transporter License* (or a “transport endorsement” on the existing license) is mandatory for any product that leaves the licensed premises, even if it stays within the same county. | No in‑state exemption; every move triggers the transporter requirement. |\n| **Washington** | **Yes** – a *Transporter Permit* is required for any movement of cannabis or cannabis products between licensed locations. | Internal moves within a single “licensed building” are exempt. |\n| **Oregon** | **Yes** – a *Transporter License* (or a “transport endorsement” on the primary license) is for any product leaving the origin site. | Same‑site transfers are exempt. |\n| **Michigan** | **Yes** – a *Transporter License* is required for any movement of cannabis between licensed facilities, even within the same municipality. | No exemption for same‑site moves; the originating license can act as its own transporter if it holds the transport endorsement. |\n| **Illinois** | **Yes** – a *Transporter License* is required for any product transferred between licensed entities. | Same‑site transfers are exempt. |\n| **Massachusetts** | **Yes** – a *Transporter Permit* (or a “transport endorsement” on the primary license) is required for any movement that leaves the original licensed premises. | Same‑site transfers are exempt. |\n| **Arizona** | **Yes** – a *Transporter License* is required for any movement that crosses a property line, even between two on the same campus. | No in‑state exemption. |\n| **New York** (2024) | **Yes** – a *Transporter License* is required for any movement of cannabis between licensed entities. | Same‑site moves are exempt. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** *If you are moving product from one licensed location to another (even if both are in the same city or county), you need a licensed transporter.*  \n\n---\n\n## 3.

      "expectedAnswer": "**Clarifying cannabis transporter requirements** I need to summarize the requirements for a licensed cannabis transporter in New York, specifically for in-state product transfers. I should focus on New York cannabis regulations regarding adult-use licensed businesses, including cultivators, processors, distributors, and retail dispensaries. In New York, there are different licenses: the \"Cannabis Transporter\" license for third-party logistics and a \"Distributor\" license. Typically, cannabis product movement between licensees must be done by a licensed transporter, although some states allow self-distribution without a separate license. I'll double-check the relevant regulations.**Understanding cannabis distribution hierarchy** I’ve realized that in the cannabis distribution chain, distributors are the only ones allowed to sell directly to retail dispensaries. Processors, on the other hand, sell their products to distributors. Cultivators focus on selling to both processors and distributors. This hierarchy is crucial for understanding how cannabis products move from cultivation through processing to retail. I’m making sure to keep these relationships clear as I work on the summary!**Summarizing cannabis transportation regulations** I need to create a concise summary for grading responses about whether a licensed cannabis transporter is required for in-state product transfers in New York.

      "response": "**Short answer:** Yes—most jurisdictions and most business contracts require you to notify the receiving party before sending a partial shipment.\n\n---\n\n### Why notification is important\n\n| Reason | What it means for you |\n|--------|-----------------------|\n| **Regulatory compliance** | In regulated cannabis markets (e.g., most U.S. states, Canada, EU member states), any outbound shipment must be recorded in the state‑run seed‑to‑sale or traceability system. The manifest you submit usually specifies the exact quantity and product type. Sending a partial load without updating the manifest (and therefore the receiver) can trigger a compliance violation, fines, or a revocation of your license. |\n| **Carrier requirements** | Many licensed carriers (e.g., Safe Express, Greenway, etc.) require the shipper to submit a **manifest amendment** for any change in weight or product mix. The carrier will often need the receiver’s acknowledgment before they’ll accept the load. |\n| **Contractual obligations** | Purchase agreements often contain a “delivery notice” clause that obliges the seller to give the buyer reasonable notice (usually 24‑48 hours) of any change to the quantity, delivery date, or packaging. Failure to do so can be considered a breach of contract. |\n| **Operational logistics** | The receiving facility must allocate staff, storage space, and security resources. Unexpected partial shipments can cause congestion, missed inspections, or inventory mismatches. |\n| **Quality‑control & testing** | If the partial shipment changes the batch composition, the receiver may need to re‑run lab tests or adjust their compliance paperwork. Early notice avoids costly re‑testing. |\n\n---\n\n### Typical steps to follow\n\n1. **Check the purchase order / contract** – locate the “delivery notice” or “partial shipment” clause. Note the required notice period (often 24 h, but sometimes 72 h).\n2. **Update the seed‑to‑sale manifest** – create an amendment that reflects the reduced quantity and any new lot numbers.\n3. **Send a formal notice** – email or EDI message to the buyer that includes:  \n   * PO number & original shipment details  \n   * Revised quantity & weight  \n   * Expected departure & arrival times  \n   * Reason for the partial shipment (e.g., inventory shortage, production hold)  \n   * Request for acknowledgment or acceptance.\n4. **Confirm carrier compliance** – ensure the carrier’s system (e.g., METRC, BioTrackTHC) reflects the amendment; some carriers require the receiver’s signature before they will load the truck.\n5. **Document the acknowledgment** – keep a copy of the buyer’s reply (email, signed PDF, EDI ACK) in your records for audit purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Exceptions (rare)\n\n* **Pre‑approved “split‑load” contracts** – Some agreements explicitly allow the seller to split deliveries without additional notice, provided the total quantity matches the PO. Even then, most regulators still require the manifest to be accurate for each load.\n* **Emergency or force‑majeure events** – If a natural disaster or equipment failure forces an immediate partial shipment, you should still notify the receiver as soon as practicable and document the reason.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Yes, you should notify the receiving party before sending a partial shipment.**  \n- Do it **in writing**, **update the regulatory manifest**, and **obtain acknowledgment** to stay compliant and protect both parties from contractual or regulatory fallout.  \n\nIf you need a template for a partial‑shipment notice or guidance on updating your specific state’s seed‑to‑sale system, let me know!\n\n---\n*Agent: F8 Multi-Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1027 (167?860) | Cost: $0.000000*",

      "feedback": "Good general guidance and practical steps, but it should be tailored to New York. Explicitly cite that NY uses the New York State Cannabis Track-and-Trace System (BioTrack) and that a compliant transfer manifest must reflect any partial quantity before transport. Note that receiving licensees should be notified prior to arrival, with delivery scheduled/acknowledged, and that all changes must be updated in the state system rather than carrier systems. Avoid broad jurisdictional claims and focus on NY OCM rules for distributors, cultivators, and processors. Including NY-specific terminology and requirements would improve accuracy and completeness.",

      "expectedAnswer": "**Summarizing partial shipment notification** I need to create a concise summary addressing whether the receiving party must be notified before sending partial shipments. This involves New York's cannabis regulations for distributors, cultivators, and processors regarding transport and transfer. The idea of \"partial product shipment\" might mean breaking up a purchase order, which likely requires notifying the receiving party. New York uses BioTrack for tracking, and as of 2024, they have the New York State Cannabis Track-and-Trace System in place.**Clarifying transfer requirements** I need to mention that the state requires a transfer manifest to be created. It's important to properly schedule the delivery and provide notice before arrival. This process seems crucial and likely involves notifying all relevant parties to adhere to regulations. Any oversight could cause issues during transport, so I want to make sure these steps are explicitly clear in the summary for anyone involved in the shipping process."

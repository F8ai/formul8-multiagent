The test panel is usually broader than the flower‑only panel because you now have to verify that the **final‑product potency, contaminants, moisture, and any added components** all meet the state‑mandated limits.\n\nBelow is a practical, step‑by‑step checklist that works for most U.S. state programs (California, Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Massachusetts, etc.).

      "response": "**Short answer:** In most regulated markets you **cannot** ship an infused pre‑roll without a fresh laboratory analysis of the finished product, even if the flower and concentrate you used have already been tested. The act of blending, heating, or otherwise processing those inputs creates a *new* product whose potency, contaminant profile, and stability must be verified.\n\nBelow is a concise breakdown of why retesting is required, the regulatory landscape, and practical steps you can take to keep the testing burden as low as possible while staying compliant.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why the finished pre‑roll is a “new” product\n\n| Factor | How it changes during infusion |\n|--------|--------------------------------|\n| **Potent % (THC, CBD, minor cannabinoids)** | Dilution of concentrate into flower, loss of volatiles during gentle heating, possible decarboxylation differences. |\n| **Terpene profile** | Terpenes can evaporate, oxidize, or redistribute, altering both aroma and perceived potency. |\n| **Residual solvents** | If the concentrate was solvent‑based, any residual solvent can migrate into the flower matrix during mixing/heating. |\n| **Microbial load** | Adding moisture (e.g., from a terpene‑rich concentrate) can raise the water activity of the final roll, potentially supporting mold growth. |\n| **Pesticide / heavy‑metal distribution** | Even if each component is clean, the final blend must be demonstrated to stay below the per‑batch limits set by the state. |\n| **Physical consistency** | Uniformity of dose per joint is a quality‑control issue that regulators often require validated testing for. |\n\nBecause each of those variables can shift, the finished pre‑roll is treated by regulators as a **new batch** that must be independently verified.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Typical regulatory requirements (U.S. state‑level snapshot)\n\n| State | Requirement for “derived” products (e.g., infused pre‑rolls) |\n|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **California** | Every finished product must have a COA covering potency, residual solvents, pesticides, heavy metals, and microbial. Using a “derived product” exemption is only allowed for raw flower that is simply packaged, not for blended products. |\n| **Colorado** | A new COA is required for any product whose composition differs from the source material; potency and contaminants must be tested on the final product. |\n| **Oregon** | Finished products must be tested for potency and contaminants; a “derived product” exemption applies only when the product is **identical** to the tested source (no blending or processing). |\n| **Washington** | All manufactured cannabis products, including infused pre‑rolls, need a fresh COA. |\n| **Illinois** | Mandatory testing of the final product for potency, residual solvents, pesticides, heavy metals, and microbiology. |\n| **Canada (federal)** | A new batch of a manufactured product (e.g., “infused joint”) must be tested for potency, contaminants, and stability; a “source material” COA alone is insufficient. |\n\n**Bottom line:** In the vast majority of jurisdictions, the law treats an infused pre‑roll as a *manufactured cannabis product* and therefore requires a **new laboratory analysis** for each batch.\n\n---\n\n## 3. What testing is typically required for an infused pre‑roll\n\n| Test | Why it matters |\n|------|----------------|\n| **Potency (THC, CBD, minor cannabinoids)** | Confirms the labeled dose per joint and verifies that the blend achieved the target ratio. |\n| **Residual solvents** | Especially important if the concentrate was made with butane, propane, ethanol, CO₂, etc. |\n| **P\n\n---\n*Agent: Formulation Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1181 (181?1000) | Cost: $0.000000*",

Additionally, total THC per serving or pack and net weight will also require attention. There could be some allowances for compositing during this testing process, but I need to confirm that detail."

      "response": "**Short answer:**  \nIn most U.S. states that regulate cannabis‑infused products you **must list a “manufacture/production date” (or a “batch/lot number” that can be traced back to that date)**. A “harvest date” is rarely required on the finished infused product, though some states ask for it on the raw‑cannabis inventory that feeds the infusion process.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the major states say\n\n| State | Required on the final infused product | Harvest date required? | Typical label fields |\n|-------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| **California (Beverage, Edible, Topical, etc.)** | **Manufacture/Production date** (MM/DD/YYYY) **and** “Sell‑by” or “Use‑by” date. | Not required on the consumer label (only on the raw‑cannabis tracking sheet). | Product name, net weight/volume, THC/CBD potency, batch/lot #, QR code, warnings, serving size, allergens, manufacturer info. |\n| **Colorado** | **Manufacture date** (or “Packaging date”) and “Expiration date”. | Not required on the consumer label. | Same as CA plus “Cultivar” (optional) and “Total THC”. |\n| **Oregon** | **Production/Packaging date** and “Expiration date” (must be ≤ 1 yr for edibles). | Not required on the consumer label. | Batch/lot #, potency, allergens, serving size, warnings. |\n| **Washington** | **Production date** (MM/DD/YYYY) and “Expiration date”. | Not required on the consumer label. | Batch/lot #, THC/CBD per serving, warnings, QR code. |\n| **Michigan** | **Manufacturing date** and “Best‑by” date. | Not required on the consumer label. | Batch/lot, potency, warnings, allergens. |\n| **Massachusetts** | **Manufacture date** and “Expiration date”. | Not required on the consumer label. | Batch/lot #, potency, warnings, serving size. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** All of the states above (the ones with the most mature markets) require a *production/manufacture/packaging* date on the consumer‑facing label.

What you should put on the label (minimum for most states)\n\n1. **Product name & brand**  \n2. **Net weight/volume** (e.g., 10 g, 30 mL)  \n3. **THC / CBD potency** (per serving and per package)  \n4. **Serving size** (for edibles)  \n5. **Manufacture/Production date** (MM/DD/YYYY) – *required*  \n6. **Expiration/“Best‑by” date** – calculated from the manufacture date per state limits (often 1 yr for edibles, 2 \n\n---\n*Agent: F8 Multi-Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1165 (165?1000) | Cost: $0.000000*",

      "expectedAnswer": "**Summarizing cannabis compliance requirements** I need to create a concise summary for a question about New York's cannabis infusion regulations. The focus is on product testing and infusion rules, especially concerning terpenes. The summary should cover the main conclusion, key requirements, regulatory details, and state-specific info, without any commentary. I'll ensure it addresses the NY OCM/CRTA adult-use regulations, noting the restrictions on flavor additives, terpenes, synthetic cannabinoids, and other potentially harmful additives. The goal is 100-200 words.**Clarifying terpene regulations in NY** New York permits \"naturally occurring terpenes\" from cannabis or botanical sources as long as they meet certain criteria. They need to be food-grade and generally recognized as safe (GRAS). Additionally, these terpenes cannot be used for flavoring products aimed at minors. It's essential to list them on the ingredient panel with their common or usual name and source. There are also specific excipient requirements to consider, which will be crucial for compliance."

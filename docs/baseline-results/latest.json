Use it as a checklist while you verify the details for your particular state.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Licensure & Business Structure\n| Requirement | Typical Details |\n|------------|-----------------|\n| **Cannabis/used‑Product License** | Separate licenses are often required for (a) cultivation, (b) processing/manufacturing, and (c) retail. Some states combine processing and manufacturing into a single “infused‑product” license. |\n| **Facility Registration** | Must be a registered “manufacturing” or “processing” site, often subject to zoning, security, and inspection rules. |\n| **Background Checks** | Owners, officers, and key personnel usually undergo criminal‑history screening. |\n| **Ownership Limits** | Many states cap the percentage of ownership that can be held by non‑licensed individuals or entities. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Ingredient & Source Compliance\n| Item | What to Verify |\n|------|----------------|\n| **Cannabis‑Derived Terpenes** | Must be extracted from legally cultivated cannabis that is tracked through the state’s seed‑to‑sale system. |\n| **Botanical‑Derived Terpenes** | Even if the source plant is legal (e.g., lavender, citrus), the terpene isolate may still be regulated as a “controlled substance” if it is chemically identical to a cannabis terpene. Some states require a separate “food‑grade botanical” registration. |\n| **GRAS/USP Status** | For food‑or‑beverage applications, confirm the terpene is recognized as Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) or has a USP monograph. |\n| **Supplier Documentation** • COA (Certificate of Analysis) <br>• Batch/lot traceability <br>• Pesticide & heavy‑metal testing results | Required for every incoming batch. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Product Formulation Limits\n| Parameter | Common State Limits |\n|-----------|--------------------|\n| **THC Concentration** | Ranges from 0.3 % (hemp) up to 10 % or higher for “adult‑use” markets. Some states cap per‑serving THC (e.g., 5 mg per edible). |\n| **CBD Concentration** Often unrestricted, but may be capped in “food” categories. |\n| **Total Cannabinoid Load** | Some states limit the combined THC + CBD per package (e.g., ≤ 100 mg). |\n| **Terpene Percentage** | Usually limited to a “flavoring” threshold (e.g., ≤ 5 % of total weight) unless the terpene is considered a “cannabinoid‑derived ingredient.” |\n| **Other Cannabinoids** | Δ‑8‑THC, Δ‑9‑THC‑v, HHC, etc., are frequently prohibited or subject to separate scheduling. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Testing & Quality‑Control\n1. **State‑Approved Lab** – Must submit each batch for mandatory testing (potency, pesticides, residual solvents, heavy metals, microbiology).  \n2. **Certificate of Analysis (COA)** – Must accompany every product lot and be retained for at least 2‑3 years.  \n3. **Stability Testing** – Required for shelf‑life claims; many states ask for a 6‑month accelerated stability protocol.  \n4. **Batch‑Traceability** – QR codes or batch\n\n---\n*Agent: Formulation Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1221 (221?1000) | Cost: $0.000000*",

Here are a few key points to consider:\n\n| Factor | Why It Matters | Typical Guidance |\n|--------|----------------|-------------------|\n| **Product type** (e.g., THC flower, vape oil, edibles, tincture) | Different delivery methods have different bioavailability and onset times. | Edibles are usually dosed in 5‑10 mg THC increments; vape oils often range 10‑30 mg per puff. |\n| **Legal limits** | Many states/countries cap the amount of THC per package (e.g., 10 mg per serving, 100 mg per package). | Check local regulations; exceeding legal limits can lead to fines or loss of product. |\n| **Individual tolerance** | Regular users may handle higher doses without adverse effects, while novices can feel uncomfortable at much lower levels. | Start low (2‑5 mg THC for beginners) and increase gradually. |\n| **Health considerations** | Certain conditions (e.g., cardiovascular issues, pregnancy) have stricter limits. | Consult a healthcare professional before taking high doses. |\n| **Desired effect** | Therapeutic vs. recreational dosing often have different targets. | Therapeutic doses often stay ≤20 mg THC per day; recreational users sometimes go higher, but the ceiling for most people is ≈100‑150 mg total THC in a single session. |\n\n### Practical Tips if You’re Considering >200 mg\n\n1. **Break it up** – Instead of a single200 mg hit, spread the dose across several hours (e.g., 4 × 50 mg edibles) to reduce the risk of overwhelmingactive effects.\n2. **Monitor your response** – Keep a journal of how you feel, noting any anxiety, heart rate changes, or cognitive impairment.\n3. **Stay hydrated & have food** – Having a meal before or during dosing can moderate the intensity.\n4. **Have a safe environment** – Be in a comfortable setting with a sober sitter if you’re trying a higher dose for the first time.\n5. **Know the legal ceiling** – If the jurisdiction caps products at 100 mg per package, you’d need to purchase multiple legal units, which may not be permissible.\n\n Line\n\n- **Yes, it’s technically possible to consume >200 mg of THC**, but it’s generally **not recommended for most users** due to the increased risk of adverse effects.\n- **Always start low, go slow**, and ensure you’re compliant with local laws.\n- **Consult a medical professional** if you have any health concerns or are using cannabis for therapeutic purposes.\n\n---\n\n**Need more specific guidance?** Let me know the exact product (e.g., “THC vape oil 30 mg/ml”) and your experience level, and I can give a tailored recommendation.\n\n---\n*Agent: F8 Multi-Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 891 (160?731) | Cost: $0.000000*",

If you’re targeting a specific state, province, or country, let me know and I can drill down to the exact rule set and any recent updates.\n\n---\n\n## 1. United States (state‑level limits)\n\n| State | Max THC per **single piece/serving** | Max THC per **package** | Low‑dose tier (optional) | Notes |\n|-------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------|\n| **California** | 10 mg | 100 mg total (10 × 10‑piece package) | 5 mg (optional “micro‑dose”) | Must label “Number of servings” and “THC per serving”. |\n| **Colorado** | 10 mg | 100 mg total | 5 mg (optional) | Same labeling rules as CA; “serving size” must be clearly defined. |\n| **Washington** | 10 mg | 100 mg total | 5 mg (optional) | Edibles must be sold in child‑resistant packaging; “single‑serve” definition is enforced. |\n| **Oregon** | 10 mg | 100 mg total | 5 mg (optional) | Edibles may be marketed as “single‑serve” only if ≤10 mg THC. |\n| **Michigan** | 10 mg | 100 mg total | 5 mg (optional) | Requires QR code linking to product COA. |\n| **Illinois** | 10 mg | 100 mg total | 5 mg (optional) | Must include “THC per serving” on the front label. |\n| **Massachusetts** | 10 mg | 100 mg total | 5 mg (optional) | Edibles must be sold in child‑proof, opaque packaging. |\n| **Other states** (e.g., Nevada, Maine, New York, etc.) | Generally 10 mg per serving, 100 mg per package | Same | 5 mg optional in many | Always verify the latest state‑specific rulebook. |\n\n**Key compliance points for U.S. states**\n\n1. **Definition of a “serving”** – A serving is the amount of product that delivers the stated THC (e.g., a 5 g brownie that contains exactly 10 mg THC). The product must be packaged so that a consumer cannot easily exceed one serving without deliberately taking more.\n2. **Labeling** – Front‑of‑package must show “THC per serving” and “Number of servings per package”. The total THC per package cannot exceed the 100 mg ceiling.\n3. **Micro‑dose option** – Many states allow a separate “micro‑dose” category (≤5 mg THC). These can be marketed as “low‑dose” and often have relaxed packaging rules (e.g., smaller child‑resistant containers).\n4. **CBD** – Most states do **not** impose a per‑piece limit on CBD, but total CBD must be disclosed on the label. Some states cap CBD at 20 mg per serving when it is marketed as a “therapeutic” product; otherwise, it is treated as a “non‑psychoactive” ingredient.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The agency has specifically warned against **Vitamin E acetate (VEA)** and any non‑cannabis‑derived synthetic solvents. |\n| **State Cannabis Boards (CA, CO, WA, OR, etc.)** | Most states require that **all diluents be cannabis‑derived or food‑grade** (e.g., MCT, terpenes, PG, VG).  Many prohibit **propylene glycol (PG) in THC products** (but allow it in nicotine e‑liquids).  VEA is **explicitly banned** in all states that have issued a VEA‑related recall. |\n| **Testing Labs** | Any batch must pass **potency, residual‑solvent,, heavy‑metal, and microbial** screens.  Diluent purity (≥ 99 % USP/FP) is a standard test item. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** Use **food‑grade, USP‑certified, cannabis‑derived** diluents.  Avoid VEA, any non‑cannabis synthetic oil, and any solvent that leaves detectable residues.\n\n---\n\n## 2. “Safe‑and‑Compliant” Diluent Options\n\n| Diluent | Typical Use | Pros | Cons / Caveats |\n|---------|-------------|------|----------------|\n| **Pure Cannabis‑Derived Terpenes** (.g., limonene, myrcene, caryophyllene) | Flavor, viscosity control, synergistic “entourage” effect | Natural, GRAS, enhances aroma & potency perception | Expensive; some terpenes (e.g., limonene) can be skin/respiratory irritants at high % – keep total terpene load ≤ 10 % v/v |\n| **Medium‑Chain Triglyceride (MCT) Oil** – USP/FP‑grade, **cannabis‑derived** (often from coconut) | Primary carrier for THC/CBD distillate; low viscosity | Very stable, neutral flavor, widely accepted in CO, OR, | Not allowed in some states for THC vape (e.g., California requires “cannabis‑derived oil” – ensure your MCT is labeled as such) |\n| **Propylene Glycol (PG)** – USP‑grade | Low‑viscosity carrier, improves wicking | Cheap, widely used in nicotine e‑liquids | **Many states forbid PG in THC cartridges** (California, Washington).  Also a known irritant at high concentrations. |\n| **Vegetable Glycerin (VG)** – USP‑grade, cannabis‑derived | Increases viscosity, smoother vapor | Generally allowed in THC products (though less common) | Higher viscosity can strain wicking; may affect coil life |\n| **Delta‑9 THC‑ or CBD‑Derived Distillate (as “diluent”)** | “Self‑dilution” to adjust potency | 100 % cannabis‑derived, no foreign excipients | Increases total THC/CBD; not a true diluent if you’re trying to lower potency |\n| **Cannabis\n\n---\n*Agent: F8 Multi-Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1178 (178?1000) | Cost: $0.000000*",

Review your state’s licensing manual** | Look for sections titled “Finished Product Storage,” “Product Security,” or “Inventory Management.” |\n| **2. Map your facility** | Identify current storage zones. If raw biomass and finished product share a room, plan a relocation or construct a partition that meets fire‑rating and security specs. |\n| **3. Upgrade access control** | Install a dedicated lock on the finished‑product room; assign unique credentials to dispensary/packaging staff only. |\n| **4. Update SOPs** | Write or revise Standard Operating Procedures for “Product Transfer,” “Room Entry,” and “Environmental Monitoring.” |\n| **5. Train staff** | Conduct a briefing on why separation matters, how to log transfers, and the penalties for non‑compliance. |\n| **6. Document everything** | Keep photos, floor plans, and inspection reports showing the separation for future regulator visits. |\n\n---\n\n## Common pitfalls to avoid\n\n| Pitfall | Consequence |\n|---------|-------------|\n| Storing “finished product” on the same shelves as cured flower | Regulators may consider it “mixed inventory leading to a compliance violation. |\n| Using a single door for both raw and finished product rooms without a **buffer zone** | Increases risk of unauthorized access and makes audit trails fuzzy. |\n| Not logging temperature/humidity separately for each area | Can cause product degradation and failure of QA checks. |\n| Allowing untrained personnel to move items between rooms without proper documentation | Leads to inventory discrepancies in METRC/Bio\n\n---\n*Agent: F8 Multi-Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1164 (164?1000) | Cost: $0.000000*",

A documented time lets you reproduce the exact profile batch‑to‑batch. |\n| **Quality‑control (QC)ability** | If a lab result shows elevated residual solvents or an off‑flavor, you can trace the deviation back to a specific purge window and adjust the SOP. |\n| **Shelf‑life & stability** | Over‑purging can volatile terpenes, while under‑purging can leave residual solvents that accelerate oxidation. Documented times help correlate stability data with processing conditions. |\n| **Liability & insurance** | In the event of a consumer complaint or recall, a complete batch record (including purge time) demonstrates due diligence. |\n\n---\n\n## What to capture for each batch\n\n| Parameter | Typical unit / range | Notes |\n|-----------|---------------------|-------|\n| **Batch ID** | Unique alphanumeric | Links to raw‑material lot numbers, COAs, etc. |\n| **Equipment** | Extractor model, purge chamber ID | Different vessels have different heat transfer rates. |\n| **Purge temperature** | °C (e.g., 120 °C) | Record set point and actual chamber temperature profile (log file). |\n| **Purge pressure** | mbar or psig (e.g., 10 mbar) | Vacuum level is a key driver of solvent removal rate. |\n| **Purge gas flow** | L/min of N₂/CO₂ (if used) | Helps explain variations in terpene loss. |\n| **Start / end time** | hh:mm:ss (or total minutes) | Include any pauses or “ramp‑down” periods. |\n| **Residual solvent result** | ppm (lab COA) | Should be taken *after the documented purge. |\n| **Operator** | Name / ID | For accountability and training tracking. |\n| **Notes / deviations** | Free‑text | E.g., “temperature drift +5 °C for 12 min; extended purge by 5 min.” |\n\n*Tip:* Most modern purge ovens have built‑in data‑loggers that can export CSV files.

Regulatory & Compliance Check\n| Aspect | What to verify | Why it matters |\n|-------|----------------|----------------|\n| **State/Provincial limits** | THC‑% ceiling, CBD‑% floor, pesticide & heavy‑metal limits for the final product | Mixing strains can push you over legal limits or introduce new contaminants. |\n| **Labeling requirements** | Accurate cannabinoid & terpene percentages, strain disclosure (if required), “derived from multiple strains” statement | Consumers and regulators must know the source composition. |\n| **Batch‑traceability** | Unique lot numbers for each input strain, documented blend ratios | Enables recall, QA, and audit trails. |\n| **Licensing** | Some jurisdictions restrict “single‑strain” products (e.g., medical‑only formulations). | Confirm your license permits multi‑strain blends. |\n\n> **Tip:** Keep a “Strain‑Blend Matrix” in your LIMS that ties each input lot to the final batch ID.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Technical Considerations\n\n### a. **Cannabinoid & Terpene Profile Management**\n1. **Pre‑blend analysis** – Run a quick COA on each strain (THC, CBD, minor cannabinoids, major terpenes, residual solvents).  \n2. **Target profile** – Define the desired final percentages (e.g., 18 % THC, 2 % CBD, 1 % myrcene).  \n3. **Blend calculation** – Use a mass‑balance equation:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Final %} = \\frac{\\sum ( \\text{Input %}_i \\times \\text{Weight}_i )}{\\sum \\{Weight}_i}\n\\]\n\n4. **Iterate** – Adjust input weights until the target falls within ±5 % of each key component.\n\n### b. **Extraction Method Compatibility**\n| Method | Strain‑compatibility notes |\n|--------|---------------------------|\n| **Supercritical CO₂** | Works well with both high‑THC and high‑CBD strains; adjust pressure/temperature to capture desired terpene range. |\n| **Hydrocarbon (butane/propane)** | Some strains have higher wax/lipid content → may need a winterization step after blending. |\n| **Ethanol** | Tolerates mixed‑strain material; watch for increased chlorophyll if one strain is leafy. |\n\n> **Best practice:** Perform a small pilot run (≈5 % batch size) to confirm extraction efficiency before scaling.\n\n### c. **Physical Mixing**\n- **Dry‑weight blend** before extraction → ensures homogenous input to the extractor.\n- **In‑process mixing** (e.g., after first pass CO₂) can help “even out” cannabinoid distribution if the extractor’s flow profile is uneven.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Quality‑Control Workflow\n\n1. **Incoming QC** – Test each strain lot (potency, contaminants, moisture). Reject any out‑of‑spec material.  \n2. **In‑process QC** – After extraction, take a representative sample for:\n   - Potency (HPLC/GC‑MS)\n   - Terpene fingerprint (GC‑FID)\n   - Residual solvent (GC‑FID)\n3. **Final QC** – Confirm that the blended product meets the target profile and all regulatory limits.  \n4. **Stability testing** – Multi‑strain blends can exhibit different oxidation rates; run a 3‑month accelerated stability study (40 °C/75 % RH) to set shelf‑life.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Re‑packaging bulk oil into smaller units is considered a “new package” and therefore requires its own identifier.\n\n---\n\n## Why a new UID is required\n\n| Reason | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Traceability** | The state seed‑to‑sale system (METRC, BioTrackTHC, etc.) tracks each **package** from cultivation through sale. When you split a bulk container, the system can no longer tie the smaller units to the original UID unless a new record is created. |\n| **Inventory integrity** | A bulk container’s weight/volume is reduced when you remove product. The system must reflect the exact remaining balance of the original container and the quantity moved into each new package. |\n| **Compliance audits** | Inspectors will look for a one‑to‑one relationship between the physical package and its electronic record. Missing or duplicated UIDs are a common violation. |\n| **Consumer safety** | New packaging often includes batch/lot, potency, and warning information that must be linked to a unique identifier. |\n\n---\n\n## Typical workflow (example: METRC)\n\n1. **Create a “Transfer”** from the bulk container (source) to a “new package” (destination).  \n2. **Generate a new UID** for each destination package (the system will auto‑assign one or let you scan a pre‑printed label).  \n3. **Enter weight/volume** for each new package. The bulk container’s remaining quantity is automatically updated.  \n4. **Print and affix labels** (including the new UID, product name, potency, batch/lot, etc.).  \n5. **Record the transaction** in your inventory software and retain the supporting paperwork.\n\n---\n\n## Exceptions & nuances\n\n| State/Province | Notable exception |\n|----------------|-------------------|\n| **California (CANNABIS)** | If the bulk container is labeled as “repackaging only” and you keep the product **within the same licensed facility**, you still must generate a new tag for each repackaged unit. |\n| **Colorado** | Requires a new tag for each new package; bulk “repackage” transfers are logged as “Repackaging” with new identifiers. |\n| **Ontario (Canada)** | The Cannabis Tracking System (CTS) mandates a new package ID for any subdivision of a bulk container. |\n| **Massachusetts** | Allows “bulk to bulk” transfers without a new tag only when the bulk stays in the same sealed container; once you create a smaller container you need a new tag. |\n\n> **Bottom line:** Even if your state’s rulebook uses different terminology (e.g., “tag,” “label,” “package ID”), the principle is the same—**every distinct package that leaves the original bulk container must have its own UID.**\n\n---\n\n## Practical tips\n\n1. **Print labels in advance** – Many labs/packagers use pre‑printed rolls that include a sequential UID range to speed up the repackaging line.\n2. **Batch your repackaging** – Group the same oil type/potency together so you can reuse the same batch/lot number across all new packages, reducing data entry.\n3. **Document the source** – Keep a “ bulk UID → destination UIDs” log (often auto‑generated by the tracking software) in case of an audit.\n4. **Train staff** – Ensure the team knows that “re‑labeling” a small bottle without generating a new UID is a compliance violation.\n5. **Audit your workflow** – Run a quarterly reconciliation between physical inventory and the seed‑to‑sale system to catch any missed UID entries.\n\n---\n\n## Need more detailed, jurisdiction‑specific guidance?\n\nIf you tell me the state/province (or the specific seed‑to‑sale system you’re using), I can:\n\n- Point you to the exact regulatory citation.  \n- Provide a step‑by‑step SOP template for your repackaging line.\n\n---\n*Agent: F8 Multi-Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1166 (166?1000) | Cost: $0.000000*",

Remove or correct inaccurate cross-state citations and avoid overgeneralizing container requirements. Tighten the presentation by removing extraneous text and fixing the incomplete bullet.",

      "expectedAnswer": "**Summarizing cannabis waste compliance in NY** It's crucial to understand New York's cannabis waste regulations regarding temporary storage with general lab trash. As of 2023-2025, compliance agents must refer to New York Office of Cannabis Management (OCM) and MRTA regulations. Key points include Parts 125, 128, and 131 concerning licensee operations and waste management. Under 9 NYCRR Title 9, conditions dictate that cannabis waste should generally be stored separately to ensure compliance with safety and regulatory standards during operation.**Researching cannabis waste regulations** I need to summarize the compliance question regarding storing cannabis waste alongside general lab trash in New York. The key is to understand that as of 2023-2025, the NY OCM and MRTA regulations dictate that cannabis waste must be managed according to specific guidelines found in Parts 125, 128, and 131 of the regulations. There are requirements for waste disposal, and ensuring adherence to these rules is critical for compliance in the cannabis industry."

      "response": "**Short answer:** In most U.S. jurisdictions you **must have a second, authorized person witness and sign off on the destruction of cannabis waste**, but the exact requirement varies by state and by the destruction method you use.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Why a “secondary person” is generally required  \n\n| Reason | What it looks like in practice |\n|--------|--------------------------------|\n| **Regulatory control** – Prevents diversion of waste back into the market. | A second employee (or a third‑party contractor) watches the incinerator, chemical neutralizer, or shredding equipment and signs the waste‑manifest. |\n| **Chain‑of‑custody integrity** – Creates an auditable trail. | Both signatures (or electronic approvals) are entered on the state‑issued waste‑tracking form (e.g., California’s **Track‑and‑Trace (TnT) Manifest**, Colorado’s **MARS** system). |\n| **Safety & compliance** – Ensures the method is performed correctly and that all hazardous by‑products are handled. | The witness confirms that temperature, residence time, or chemical dosage met the state‑mandated specifications. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Typical state requirements (2024‑2025)\n\n| State | Minimum waste‑destruction method(s) | Secondary‑person rule? |\n|-------|------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| **California (BPC, BCC)** | Incineration, chemical neutralization, shredding/composting of non‑THC waste | **Yes** – A second authorized employee must be present and sign the *Track‑and‑Trace* manifest for every batch. |\n| **Colorado** | Incineration, chemical neutralization, approved “waste‑to‑energy” plants | **Yes** – The “witness” must be a licensed employee or a third‑party waste‑disposal contractor; both parties sign the *MARS* record. |\n| **Oregon** | Incineration, chemical neutralization, “controlled‑environment” shredding | **Yes** – Two signatures (operator + witness) are required on the state‑issued waste log. |\n| **Michigan** Incineration, chemical neutralization, composting of plant material | **Yes** – A second authorized staff member must sign the *Michigan Cannabis Regulatory Agency* waste‑tracking form. |\n| **Washington** | Incineration, chemical neutralization, “closed‑loop” autoclave | **Yes** – Dual‑signature requirement for each destruction event. |\n| **Other states (e.g., Maine, Nevada, Illinois)** | Varies, but most have a **dual‑sign** or **witness** clause in their waste‑management SOPs. | **Generally yes** – Even if the statute is silent, the licensing authority typically expects a witness. |\n\n*If your state is not listed, check the most recent version of its cannabis‑waste regulations or contact the state licensing board.*\n\n---\n\n## 3. What qualifies as a “secondary person”?\n\n| Qualification | Typical examples |\n|----------------|------------------|\n| **Authorized employee** – Holds a valid state cannabis‑business license and is listed on the facility’s staff roster. | Production manager, compliance officer, or designated “waste‑witness”. |\n| **Third‑party contractor** – A licensed waste‑disposal company that performs the destruction on your behalf. | Certified incineration service, EPA‑registered chemical neutralizer.| **Regulatory inspector** – Rare, only for spot‑checks. | Not required for routine batches. |\n\n*The person must be able to attest that the destruction occurred exactly as recorded; they cannot be the sole operator of the equipment.*\n\n---\n\n## 4. Practical steps to stay compliant\n\n1. **Create a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**\n   - Define who can act as the “witness” (e.g., Compliance Officer or Production Lead).\n   - Include a checklist of parameters to verify (temperature, time, chemical concentration, equipment ID).\n\n2. **Use dual‑signature waste manifests**\n   - Paper or electronic (most state portals support e‑signatures).\n   - Retain copies for the required retention period (often **2–5 years**).\n\n\n\n---\n*Agent: F8 Multi-Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1164 (164?1000) | Cost: $0.000000*",

      "expectedAnswer": "**Summarizing cannabis waste regulations** I'm focusing on summarizing the expected answer about whether a secondary person is needed to verify the destruction of cannabis waste in New York. I need to clarify the specific state regulations, particularly the Office of Cannabis Management rules, which could include Parts 130-134 for adult use and possibly Part 132 for operations. I'll remember that in many states, a witness and video are required for destruction. For New York's regulations, cannabis waste must be unusable and mixed with non-cannabis materials before disposal.**Detailing record-keeping requirements** I need to emphasize that specific records must be maintained regarding cannabis waste destruction, including the date, time, method, amount, reason, and personnel involved. It's crucial to ensure these records are stored securely and are not accessible to the public. This helps maintain compliance and accountability in waste management. I'll make sure the user understands the importance of these details for proper documentation. need to ensure that all records are kept properly, including the date, time, method, amount, reason, and personnel involved. It's crucial that these records are stored securely and are not accessible to the public. I think it’s essential to be diligent about maintaining this information to uphold any necessary standards or regulations. So, I need to focus on keeping things organized and safe!"

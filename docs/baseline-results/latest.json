      "response": "**Short answer:** In most regulated markets you **must retest the finished pre‑roll** even if the flower and concentrate you used have already been certified. The act of blending, infusing, and rolling creates a new product with its own potency, uniformity, and possible contamination profile, all of which are required to be verified before the product can be sold or distributed.\n\n---\n\n## Why a new test is required\n\n| Reason | What changes when you make an infused pre‑roll? |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| **Potency shift** | The final THC/CBD % is a weighted average of flower + concentrate plus any loss during processing. Small variations in mixing can produce batch‑to‑batch differences that must be documented. |\n| **Homogeneity** | Regulations (e.g., USDA‑FSMA, COA‑specific state rules) demand that each unit of a finished product fall within a specified potency range (often ±10 % of the label claim). Testing confirms that the roll‑up process achieved that uniformity. |\n| **Contaminant carry‑over** | Even though the inputs were clean, the **process** can introduce contaminants: metal particles from equipment, microbial growth from handling, or residual solvents if the concentrate was not fully purged. |\n| **Shelf‑life & stability** | Infused pre‑rolls may oxidize or degrade faster than the raw material. Stability testing (or at least a “post‑mix” potency check) is required for label expiration dates. |\n| **Regulatory compliance** | Most state/ provincial cannabis statutes (e.g., California’s BCC, Colorado’s MCR, Canada’s Cannabis Act) explicitly require a **finished‑product COA** for any product that leaves the manufacturing area. The COA must be generated from a sample taken after the final packaging step. |\n| **Liability & consumer safety** | A mislabeled potency claim can trigger recalls, fines, and legal exposure. Independent verification protects both the brand and the consumer. |\n\n---\n\n## When a “re‑test” might be waived (rare exceptions)\n\n| Situation | Typical jurisdictional stance | Practical notes |\n|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Batch‑size < 1 g** (e.g., single‑use “research” sample) | Some labs allow a “single‑use exemption” if the product never enters commerce. | Only for internal R&D; not for commercial sale. |\n| **Same‑day “in‑house” verification** | Some states allow a **“lot‑release”** test performed by an accredited in‑house lab, provided the lab holds a valid license and follows the state‑mandated sampling plan. | Still a test—just performed internally rather than sending out. |\n| **Pre‑approved formulation** | In a few jurisdictions, a manufacturer can submit a validated formulation (including mixing ratios, SOPs, and a one‑time full COA) and receive a “process exemption” for subsequent identical batches. | Requires prior approval, strict SOP control, and periodic audit. |\n\nIf none of the above apply to your operation, you must obtain a fresh COA for the finished pre‑roll.\n\n---\n\n## Practical workflow to keep testing burden low\n\n1. **Calculate target potency**  \n   - Use the known %THC/CBD of flower (F) and concentrate (C) and the desired final % (P).  \n   - Example: 0.5 g flower @ 18 % THC + 0.1 g concentrate @ 80 % THC → total THC = (0.5 g × 0.18)+(0.1 g × 0.80)=0.09 g+0.08 g=0.17 g.  \n   - Final weight = 0.6 g → THC% ≈ 28 % (or 280 mg per gram). Adjust ratios until you land in the label window.\n\n2. **Standardize the mixing process**  \n   - Use a calibrated balance (\n\n---\n*Agent: Formulation Agent | Plan: Standard | Tokens: 1214 (214?1000) | Cost: $0.000000*",
